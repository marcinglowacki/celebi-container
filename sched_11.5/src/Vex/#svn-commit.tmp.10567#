Added support for satellites

The .key file can specify satellites but the scheduler currently
ignores them.  The added logic has it emit in the source definition a
source_type statement of the form:

source_type = file : id;

where the file is either a TLE or a BSP file.  The ID is an integer
that identifies the object within the file.  This is a misuse of the
source_type statement in current vex syntax but it's currently not
used in its defined meaning and was ignored in vex2script.
