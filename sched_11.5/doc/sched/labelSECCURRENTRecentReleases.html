     long

     with
     a
     combined
     source
     catalog,
     <span 
class="cmsl-10">sources.vlba</span>,
     that
     contained
     sources
     from
     JVAS,
     an
     old
     VLA
     calibrator
     list,
     the
     GSFC
     solutions,
     the
     Petrov
     RFC
     solutions
     and
     possibly
     others.
     Creating
     the
     combined
     list
     has
     been
     a
     somewhat
     painful
     job,
     especially
     when
     the
     input
     catalog
     formats
     change.
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Now
     both
     Goddard
     and
     Petrov
     are
     providing
     ready-to-use
     catalogs,
     and
     those
     catalogs
     have
     many
     thousands
     of
     sources
     so
     the
     need
     for
     the
     combined
     catalog
     is
     mostly
     gone.
     Plus
     the
     remaining
     non-geodetic
     sources
     are
     likely
     not
     good
     VLBI
     sources.
     Producing
     the
     combined
     catalog
     was
     always
     a
     chore
     for
     reasons
     that
     were
     rarely
                                                                                
                                                                                
     forseen.
     I
     have
     now
     retired
     and
     no
     longer
     will
     be
     able
     to
     support
     the
     combination,
     so
     it
     has
     been
     abandoned.

     The

     have
     been
     converted
     to
     use
     one
     or
     the
     other
     of
     these

     The

     a

     of

     the

     so
     if
     you
     want
     to
     use
     familiar
     names
     like
     3C273
     or

     use
     it.
     The
     RFC
     catalog
     just
     has
     the
     J2000
     and
     1950
     names.
     The
     RFC
     catalog
     has
     far
     more
     sources
     &#8212;
     over
     9000
     in
     the
     2015feb

     While
     looking
                                                                                
                                                                                
     at
     the
     new
     source
     catalogs,
     I
     realized
     that
     RAERR
     has
     not
     been
     conforming
     to
     what
     was
     described
     in
     this
     manual.
     The
     manual
     claimed
     that
     the
     error
     was
     in
     mas
     of
     angular
     error
     on
     the
     sky.
     In
     practice,
     it
     has
     been
     mas,
     but
     in
     coordinate
     error.
     Note
     that
     the
     RA
     coordinate
     is
                                                                                
                                                                                
     in
     time
     seconds,
     so
     the
     reported
     error
     (mas)
     would
     need
     to
     be
     divided
     by
     15
     to
     get
     the
     actual
     coordinate
     error
     in
     the
     coordinate
     units.
     To
     get
     the
     angular
     error
     from
     the
     coordinate
     error,
     the
     value
     needs
     to
     be
     divided
     by
     cos(dec).
     Rather
     than
     change
     the
     catalogs,
     the
     description
     of
     RAERR
                                                                                
                                                                                
     in
     the
     manual
     was
     changed
     to
     say
     that
     it
     is
     the
     coordinate
     error
     in
     mas.
