     Implement
     VEX2.
     VEX2
     contains
     a
     number
     of
     features
     wanted
     or
     needed
     once
     antenna
     control
     is
     switched
     away
     from
     the
     legacy
     system
     on
     the
     VLBA.
     Already
     there
     are
     a
     number
     of
     comments
     in
     the
     VEX
     file
     that
     are
                                                                                
                                                                                
     actually
     read
     by
     vex2script.
     Those
     will
     become
     proper
     parameters.
     Implementing
     VEX2
     might
     not
     be
     a
     very
     big
     job
     if
     the
     current
     VEX
     code
     is
     modified
     by
     the
     minimum
     amount.
     But
     that
     code
     was
     written
     when
     the
     SCHED
     internal
     bookkeeping
     was
     very
     poorly
     matched
     to
     the
     VEX
     style
     (it
     was
     much
     more
                                                                                
                                                                                
     like
     the
     crd
     file
     or
     snap
     file
     style).
     The
     result
     is
     an
     unnecessary
     level
     of
     complexity
     given
     the
     newer
     SCHED
     internal
     bookkeeping.
     In
     the
     interests
     of
     code
     maintainability,
     it
     would
     be
     a
     good
     time
     to
     simplify
     the
     VEX
     code.
