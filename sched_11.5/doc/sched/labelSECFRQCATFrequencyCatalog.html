class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to check user specified
values against standard sets to warn of any oddities.
<!--l. 11642--><p class="noindent" >Most users will not touch the frequency catalog. If they need a setup that does not conform to what is
in the catalog, they should just make the necessary <a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2470003.6"><span 
class="cmtt-10">setup files</span></a> and ignore the warnings after making
sure that the special files are correct. Be very careful doing this. There are filters on many of the LO
and IF cables, at least on the VLBA, that most users probably are not aware of. Any special setup files
that do not match one of the standards should be shown to Craig Walker for approval. If it is a good
one, it may be added to the standards. However, the standard set is essentially complete for
the VLBA. If <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>complains about yours, it is likely to be in error. If a user really
wants his/her own frequency catalog, use the input parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1000003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">FREQFILE</span></a> to specify the file
name.
<!--l. 11657--><p class="noindent" >There is a lot of information about available frequencies, receivers, frequency ranges, filters etc,
especially at the VLBA, in the standard frequency catalog. A table of information about possible setups
for observations within a frequency range can be made by running <span

one frequency is given, the second will be set equal to the first. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will produce a table in
file <span 
class="cmsl-10">frequencies.list </span>containing details of the information available on how to set up these
frequencies at all known sites. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span

transfer this information to your setup files &#8212; <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will do that automatically based on
your frequency and polarization requests in the setup file. To examine the catalog itself,

<!--l. 11678--><p class="noindent" >The parameters of the frequency file tell <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>over what frequency range the group if usable and on
which stations. Most of the parameters are the same as parameters in the setup file since they are
meant for direct substitution once the correct frequency group has been identified. There is no
defaulting between groups of inputs &#8212; all parameters are reset to zero, blank, or some equivalent
value.
<!--l. 11685--><p class="noindent" >For the VLA, IF&#8217;s A and C will be assumed to apply to VLA27 while IF&#8217;s B and D will be assumed to
apply to VLA1. All standard frequency groups will have both VLA IF&#8217;s on the same frequency.
Anything more complicated requires a setup file from the user.
