<!--l. 3502--><p class="noindent" >At high observing frequencies, it can be difficult to point antennas with sufficient accuracy to keep the
target source in the beam. One tactic to improve this situation is known as reference pointing. The idea
is to peak up the pointing on a source prior to the VLBI scan. The source can be the target source, if it
is sufficiently strong. Otherwise it can be another source. It is best to find a source as close as possible
to the target, but it may be necessary to go tens of degrees to find one that is suitable. The reference
pointing is commonly done at a lower frequency than the interferometer observations for improved
SNR.
<!--l. 3512--><p class="noindent" >Reference pointing is commonly used at the VLBA for observations at 3mm. The actual pointing
observations are typically done at 7mm where the sensitivity is greater and the beam is larger. The
pointing offsets are determined by the on-line system by fitting total power measurements made while
the antenna is moved over a pattern that includes the nominal on-source, half power, and off-source
positions. Often this is done on strong SiO maser sources. One minute should be allowed for completion
of this pattern after the antenna reaches the pointing source. Once a pointing offset has been
determined, it will be used until another is determined, or the project changes. It cannot be turned off.
Optimal time intervals between pointing scans and maximum offsets to pointing sources are not yet
known. But pointing every half hour to hour on sources within about 20 degrees should be
ok.
<!--l. 3527--><p class="noindent" >The power data used for the reference pointing is measured by the legacy system baseband converters
(BBCs) which should be kept in mind when scheduling MARK5C/RDBE observations. More on that
later.
<!--l. 3531--><p class="noindent" >Because total power mode is being used for VLBA pointing, sources must be very strong &#8212; more
than about 10 Jy for continuum sources or about the same flux density averaged over the
observing bandwidth for line sources (peak Ta of about 2 K). Very few continuum sources
are strong enough, so most appropriate sources are SiO masers observed with restricted
bandwidth, usually 2 MHz, centered on the line. See the sample pointing command file
<a 
href="catalogs/peak.cmd" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">$SCHED/catalogs/peak.cmd</span></a>, provided with the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>catalogs and discussed below, for a
list of possible targets. Most of the SiO line sources are variable. The ones in <span 
class="cmsl-10">peak.cmd</span>
were thought to be good at the time the file was made. Information on masers used to be
found at the <a 
href="http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/SEST/html/telescope-calibration/index.html" >SEST web site</a>. That link is now dead. Please let me know if you know an
alternative. For information on high frequency flux densities of continuum calibrators, one can
try the <a 
href="http://carma.astro.umd.edu/cgi-bin/calfind.cgi" >CalFind</a> tool at the CARMA website. Please recommend other options if you have
them.
<!--l. 3552--><p class="noindent" >On the VLA reference pointing must be used for observations utilizing frequencies greater than 15 GHz.
Reference pointing needs 2.5 minutes on source to get solutions. See the discussion of <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2210003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">VLAPEAK</span></a> and the
comments in the example <a 
href="examples/hsaddc.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">hsaddc.key</span></a> for more details. Please see the <a 
href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/obsguide/modes/hifreq/strategy" >VLA&#8217;s high frequency strategy
guide</a> for more details. For more information on VLBI at the VLA, see <a 
href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/obsguide/modes/vlbi" >VLBI at the VLA
guide</a>.
<!--l. 3564--><p class="noindent" >For the GBT, reference pointing is recommend for frequencies of 8 GHz and higher. The interval should
be 4-5 hr for 8-10 GHz, 3-4 hr for 12-16 GHz, 1.5-2 hr for 18-26 GHz, and 30-45min for 40-50 GHz. The
pointing source should be stronger than 0.5 Jy and within 15 degrees of the target. Allow 8 minutes or
more in a non-recording scan for the pointing. For more on VLBI at the GBT, see <a 
href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~fghigo/gbtdoc/vlbinfo.html" >the GBT
documentation.</a>
<!--l. 3572--><p class="noindent" >For Effelsberg, reference pointing should be used for frequencies above 5 GHz. Like the GBT, allow 8
                                                                                
                                                                                
minutes on-source.
<!--l. 3575--><p class="noindent" >Reference pointing scans can be inserted explicitly by the observer or <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can be requested to
attempt to do the job automatically. For explicit scan insertion, the user specifies a scan with
times and a source. Other factors such as the setup can also be specified. The parameters
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1670003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PEAK</span></a> and/or <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2210003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">VLAPEAK</span></a> will need to be set and the user should consult the documentation
on those parameters. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can be requested to fill most of the required parameters
using the same information used for the automatic scan insertion discussed below. See the
discussion of the parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1740003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">POINT</span></a> for information on how to control this semi-automatic
mode.
<!--l. 3590--><p class="noindent" >Note that for the VLBA is in a transition period between the legacy control system and a new control
system similar to that on the VLA. During the transition, both systems are operating in parallel. They
cannot talk to each other, but are run from <span 
class="cmsl-10">crd </span>files (legacy) and a <span 
class="cmsl-10">vex </span>file (new system) written by
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>for the same schedule. For a project using the RDBE and MARK5C, the channel control
information must be appropriate for those devices. But the antenna control is still in the hands of the
legacy system for all cases, and reference pointing is based on power measurements made in the legacy
baseband converters. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>sets the legacy system frequencies and bandwidths to match as well as
possible those being used in the RDBE. For continuum sources, this is ok for reference
pointing. But most reference pointing is done on SiO masers using narrow bandwidths and
with frequencies set using Doppler calculations. With the DDC personality, that is also ok
because narrow bandwidths at flexible frequencies can be set, and be matched between
systems.
<!--l. 3607--><p class="noindent" >For RDBE based observations using the PFB personality, reference pointing becomes a problem. The
PFB can only use 32 MHz bandwidths at very restricted frequency set points. A scheme has been
established using the input parameters <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-730003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CRDFREQ</span></a>, <a

href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-740003.1.2"><span

href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-720003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CRDNCH</span></a>
to allow somewhat independent control of the legacy BBCs. See the descriptions of those
parameters, and the example <a 
href="examples/eg3mm_rd2.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg3mm</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_rd2.key</span></a> for details. As shown in the example, these
parameters can be used for both explicit pointing scan insertion and for use with automatic
pointing scan insertion by <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. Note that these capabilities have replaced the need
that existed when the RDBEs were first deployed for separate MARK5A and MARK5C
schedules.
<!--l. 3626--><p class="noindent" >Explicit insertion of pointing scans can be a pain and can completely dominate the work involved in
scheduling high frequency observations. Therefore <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>has a mode where it can do the work. This
mode is invoked with the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-480003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">AUTOPEAK</span></a> command and involves the use of a special set of input
parameters either from a separate file, the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1680003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PEAKFILE</span></a>, or from in-stream commands, in the main
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input, contained between <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1690003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PEAKINIT</span></a> and <span 
class="cmtt-10">ENDPEAK</span>. Three standard versions of this file are
<a 
href="catalogs/peak.cmd" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">peak.cmd</span></a> (VLBA legacy system), <a 
href="catalogs/peak_RDBE_DDC.cmd" ><span

class="cmsl-10">_RDBE</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_DDC.cmd</span></a> (use with the RDBE using the DDC

class="cmsl-10">peak</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_RDBE</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_PFB.cmd</span></a> (use with the RDBE using the PFB personality). The
three files differ only in the setup files they specify and are, in fact, constructed from the
same master file. The standard files can be used as examples of the format. It is possible to
watch details of the process by which <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>chooses pointing sources by setting the
parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1720003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PKWATCH</span></a>. Be warned that this can produce a lot of output to the <span 
class="cmsl-10">sched.runlog</span>
file.
<!--l. 3652--><p class="noindent" >There are several examples that demonstrate the use of reference pointing. The best example for the
new systems (RDBE/DDC, WIDAR etc) is <a 
href="examples/hsaddc.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">hsaddc.key</span></a>. That example demonstrates reference
pointing at the VLBA, VLA, GBT, and Effelsberg, array phasing at the VLA, and Doppler
setting with the DDC personality. As noted earlier, <a 
href="examples/eg3mm_rd2.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg3mm</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_rd2.key</span></a> demonstrates the use of
the crd parameters to schedule reference pointing when using the RDBE with the PFB
personality. For reference pointing on the VLBA using the MARK5A systems, see the &#8220;eg3mm&#8221;
examples. <a 
href="examples/eg3mma.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg3mma.key</span></a> sets up the pointing scans without any help from the automatic
features in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. <a 
href="examples/eg3mmb.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg3mmb.key</span></a> demonstrates use of the external peak command file.
<a 
href="examples/eg3mmc.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg3mmc.key</span></a> produces the same results but using <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1690003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PEAKINIT</span></a> and no external file. These examples

<!--l. 3676--><p class="noindent" >The peaking control information is organized around groups of antennas and lists of possible pointing
sources. Up to 5 groups of antennas can be specified. For full automatic pointing, separate scans will be
added for each group (this can add quite a few scans). For each group, <span

class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>finds the
source in the pointing list that can be reached most quickly from the target source, that

be added for scans observing at a frequency above a specified cutoff and only when there
is enough of a gap in the schedule to fit one or two scans plus the slew to the pointing
source from the previous VLBI source and the slew to the next VLBI source. The parameter
