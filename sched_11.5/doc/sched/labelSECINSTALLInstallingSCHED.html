<!--l. 13873--><p class="noindent" >This section is only needed if you do not have access to an installed copy of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>.
<!--l. 13876--><p class="noindent" >It is important that users obtain and use the latest version of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>when scheduling observations.
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is evolving with time to add new features, to correct bugs, to keep up with hardware changes,
and to enhance its ability to prevent errors from being made in schedules, based on experience.
There are typically one or two releases each year and they are announced on the VLBI
email exploder. At institutions where there are several VLBI users, someone should be in
charge of making sure that the latest version is available. When that option is not available,
the user should check that he/she has the latest version before attempting to schedule a
project.
<!--l. 13887--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>software, catalogs, auxiliary files, and documentation all reside in subdirectories under a
parent directory. Installing <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>involves unpacking the tar file of the distribution into such a
directory. If a canned executable is available for your type of computer, it can hopefully, used as is.
Otherwise it will be necessary to compile the program. The <span 
class="cmtt-10">SCHED </span>environment variable should be set to
the root directory where <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is installed. The <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PGPLOT </span>subroutine library is required. See below
if you need to install it.
<!--l. 13897--><p class="noindent" >The installation can be tested using the <span 
class="cmsl-10">Verify </span>script in the <span 
class="cmsl-10">examples </span>subdirectory. That script runs all
the examples and compares the results with results obtained at the time the release was
created.
<!--l. 13902--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is written in FORTRAN 77 using only a few common extensions from the standard.
Development has occurred on a variety of machines including VAXes, PCs, SUNs and Macs. Current
development is done under Linux and Mac OSX, with pre-release testing on a Sun. Old versions were
tested on Hp, SGI, IBM (AIX), and DEC Alpha, but such machines are no longer being used for
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>as far as I know. A big &#8220;thank you&#8221; to Franco Tinarelli at Bologna for performing many of
these tests. Machine dependent code has been isolated in special subdirectories under the <span 
class="cmsl-10">src/Cit </span>code
directory. There are very few. All other FORTRAN files should compile without changes on a wide
variety of machines. Note, however, that all current testing is under one or another flavor of
unix. There has been no recent testing under other operating systems. This will only change
if there is pressure to do so. Please inform the developers if you install it on something
else.
<!--l. 13918--><p class="noindent" >Note that the usual fortran compiler on unix machines (including Macs) these days are those from the
GNU Project. In the past, the compiler was g77. That works with gcc versions 3 and lower. But
development of g77 is long finished. For gcc 4 and higher, you must use gfortran which was written from
scratch. We are in the process of switching the support of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to gfortran and have done so for
                                                                                
                                                                                
various architectures as can be seen in the configure scripts. For some older versions, we may not bother
switching, but simply stop supporting, for example, 32 bit machines. By stop supporting, we mean not
provide configure scripts or test before releases. It is likely you could still use such machines. We will
also need to migrate the <span 
class="cmtt-10">spice </span>code for spacecraft tracking before we can abandon g77
completely.
<!--l. 13931--><p class="noindent" >If you plan to support <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>under more than one computer architecture, you may wish to have
subdirectories under bin and point to the appropriate one in the PATH environment variable. Or you
may wish to have entirely separate installations.
<!--l. 13936--><p class="noindent" >To install <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>, the following steps can be followed. Users of anything but unix or linux (who don&#8217;t
exist as far as we know) will have to make some modifications.
<!--l. 13940--><p class="noindent" >Users of Mac OSX will need to have X windows and the compiler installed. Also for full
functionallity, pgplot should be installed. There are some more details at the end of this
section.

<!--l. 14087--><p class="noindent" >Some VAX FORTRAN features that are commonly supported by other FORTRAN compilers remain in
the code. These features are supported by all of the compilers that we are aware of that are being used
for <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>currently. They include long variable names, in-line comments, and <span 
class="cmtt-10">END DO</span>. If you have
problems with these features, please email <span 
class="cmsl-10">cwalker@nrao.edu</span>. Considerable use was made of the
SLALIB (STARLINK) routines for precession, etc. These routines use long variable names so removing
this non-standard feature would not be easy. (email permission to use the FORTRAN SLALIB routines
has been obtained from P. Wallace, although the version under the GNU license was installed in March
2013).
<!--l. 14099--><p class="noindent" >If the code or any other files are moved from a unix or VMS machine to a machine using DOS or
Windows, beware that the end-of-line characters are different. At least on SUN and Linux, a pair of
utilities unix2dos and dos2unix can be used to fix the files. As of Dec. 2009, SCHED under Unix and
Unix-like operating systems can read DOS format files.
<!--l. 14106--><p class="noindent" >We are always interested in hearing about people&#8217;s experiences installing <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>on various machines.
If you have problems, or even success on machines other than those listed earlier, please let us know
(email to cwalker@nrao.edu). We would be especially interested if someone ports <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to a
non-unix, or unix-like (eg Linux) operating system. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>was supported under VMS and DOS in
the past and the coding style hasn&#8217;t changed, so a port to such operating systems would probably not
be difficult.
<!--l. 14115--><p class="noindent" >A recent experience installing <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>on a MacOSX 10.5.4 system showed the need to be
careful about compiler versions. That version of OSX uses version 4.0.1 of the gcc compiler.
You have to use gfortran, a Fortran 95 compiler, with gcc versions above 4.0 and g77 with
lower gcc versions. PGPLOT was loaded from the Fink, as were both g77 and gfortran, and
the PGPLOT was first built with gfortran. The build of SCHED only went smoothly after
switching to gfortran for <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. There will be similar issues wherever the switch from
gcc 3 to 4 occurs. For some details of my first install of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span
