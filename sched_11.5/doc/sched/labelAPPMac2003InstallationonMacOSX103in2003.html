<!--l. 21079--><p class="noindent" >For those with older systems, here are a few details for Mac OS X users based on my experience
installing <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>on a Mac iBook G4 system in Dec 2003 with OS X version 10.3 (Panther). Note
that, for OSX 10.5, the installation was somewhat smoother with the main issue being a need to switch
from g77 to gfortran. PGPLOT could be downloaded from the Fink. For OSX 10.3, before installing
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>, the code tools had to be installed (the installation package was already on disk, but not yet
installed) and X windows had to be installed from the OS X installation CD 3 (not CD 2 as
some documentation stated). The code tools include gcc, but not g77 (why?). A binary
version of g77 compatible with Panther was obtained from hpc.sourceforge.net. It installed
itself on download and simply worked. PGPLOT was installed. There was no PGPLOT
configuration file (<span 
class="cmsl-10">.conf </span>file) provided for OS X (there probably is one now). I made a <span 
class="cmsl-10">local.conf</span>
file starting with the one from <span 
class="cmsl-10">../src/sys</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_bsd/g77</span><span 
class="cmsl-10">_gcc.conf</span>. The following two lines were
different:
                                                                                
                                                                                
<div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-57">
&#x00A0;FFLAGD="-fno-backslash"
&#x00A0;<br />&#x00A0;LIBS="-L/usr/lib&#x00A0;-lgcc&#x00A0;-L/usr/X11R6/lib&#x00A0;-lX11"
</div>
<!--l. 21098--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 21100--><p class="noindent" >The routine that makes the font file (pgpack) caused some trouble while I was messing with various
variants on the above, but eventually worked. I suspect problems with big vs little endian byte
orders, but I&#8217;m not sure. Note that pgplot version 5.3 has OS X as a standard OS type. This
version was not released as of Aug 2008 (may never be), but might be available if you ask
nicely.
<!--l. 21107--><p class="noindent" >Once the X windows environment, gcc/g77, and PGPLOT were ready, SCHED compiled and ran with
the Makefile set up for Linux/g77 and the and the following two modified lines (one just depends on the
location of PGPLOT and the other helps it find the gcc libraries): XLD = -L/usr/lib -lgcc
-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 # Mac OS X (ie DARWIN) LPGPLOT = /usr/local/pgplot The architecture
still claimed to be LINUX and the g77 compiler flags were the same. That&#8217;s all it took! It
compiled and passed the verification tests. If you are using FINK, some details may be
different.
<!--l. 21117--><p class="noindent" >If you run into problems with some missing .h files, you might have a mismatched OS version and
XCODE version, as I did.
<!--l. 21120--><p class="noindent" >I now have <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>on a Powerbook G4 (OSX 10.3 still) and that is now one of the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>development
platforms.
