<!--l. 452--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is a program for scheduling Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) Observations. It can
be used to schedule any observations on antennas that use the VLBA real time control software and to
schedule Mark IV/VLBA(4)/S2/Mark5 observations on any stations that can read VEX format
schedules. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is the program used to schedule essentially all non-geodetic VLBA projects and has
been adopted by the European VLBI Network (EVN) as the standard scheduling program for the
EVN. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is also a useful tool for planning observations, both at proposal writing time
and before making detailed schedules. The plotting capabilities are especially useful for
this.
<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >To use <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>, one normally creates an input file, using any text editor, that describes the schedule.
Then <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is run on that file. A number of <a 
href="labelSECEXAMPLESExamples.html#x9-80001.4">examples</a> are distributed with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. The usual and
recommended way to make a schedule is to copy one of the examples and modify it according to your
specific needs. When developing a schedule, it is likely that <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will be run several times before
everything is to the scheduler&#8217;s satisfaction. The various output files, especially the summary file and
the optional <a 
href="labelSECPLOTPlotting.html#x10-110001.5">plots</a>, provide a lot of information about the schedule that can be used to help the user
with optimization.
<!--l. 477--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>gets a lot of information, including station locations and equipment, source positions, and
frequency setups, from a number of catalogs. Most catalogs can be imbedded in the schedule, but it is
much more common to use the standard ones provided with the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>distribution. An effort has
been made to put as much information as possible in the catalogs so that the user only need provide
very generic information specific to the particular project. But if the user wants to do something
special, it is possible to specify the parameters of an observation in great detail. Documenting all these
capabilities partially explains the large size of this manual, most of which is not needed by the average
user.
<!--l. 489--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>writes several different types of output files, some of which are useful for the scheduler and
some of which are meant for the computers at the antennas. An outline of the files used by
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can be found in <a 
href="labelSECFILESSCHEDInputandOutputFiles.html#x8-70001.3">the section on files.</a> The summary file is the most important one for the user.
It gives the details of the equipment setups at each station and a summary of various items about the
individual scans.
<!--l. 498--><p class="noindent" >The beginning user might start by looking at one or more of the <a 
href="labelSECEXAMPLESExamples.html#x9-80001.4">example files</a> to get a sense of what
they look like. Then read some of the sections that cover important details, without which it might be
difficult to understand what is going on. The section on <a 
href="labelSECKEYINKeyinFreeformatInput.html#x7-60001.2">KEYIN Free Format Input</a> covers the
capabilities and limitations of the parser used to read all input files. The section on <a 
href="labelSECFILESSCHEDInputandOutputFiles.html#x8-70001.3">Inpuut and Output
                                                                                
                                                                                
files</a> gives an overview of the information that <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>requires. <a 
href="labelSECRUNSCHEDRunningSCHED.html#x35-3030004.2">The Running <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>section</a> has
instructions on how to start the program. And <a 
href="labelSECEXAMPLESExamples.html#x9-80001.4">the Examples section</a> contains 2 examples of
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input files and quick descriptions of, and links to, most of the rest provided with the
distribution.
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >After reading the sections recommended above, it would probably be best to use one of the examples to
experiment with the program. The examples are complete, working files. In fact, they are all used
regularly to test <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>modifications. They will work as is, and it can be modified to try other
features. The easiest way to make a schedule for your project will usually be to select the example
that is closest to what you are trying to do and modify it to your needs. It is not strictly
necessary to read the rest of the manual. It can be treated as a reference to help answer
questions.
<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >The files needed to run <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>are in various subdirectories under the base directory used for the
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>installation. That base directory, on unix systems, should be assigned by you or
your system administrators to the environment variable <span 
class="cmsl-10">SCHED</span>. The key subdirectories
are <span 
class="cmsl-10">examples</span>, <span 
class="cmsl-10">setups</span>, <span 
class="cmsl-10">catalogs</span>, <span 
class="cmsl-10">doc</span>, <span 
class="cmsl-10">src</span>, and <span 
class="cmsl-10">bin </span>and can be referred to, on unix systems,
using paths such as <span 
class="cmsl-10">$SCHED/catalogs</span>. For most the contents are obvious from the names.
<span 
class="cmsl-10">src </span>contains the code and <span 
class="cmsl-10">bin </span>contains the executables, perhaps in architecture dependent
subdirectories. The user should work in a private directory and only refer to files in the
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>standard areas, not modify them. All <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>output files are written in the current working
directory.
<!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >There is a lot of information about <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>and about the process of scheduling VLBI observations in
the descriptions of the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-440003.1">input parameters</a> and of the <a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2500003.6.3">parameters for the setup files</a>. There are detailed
discussions of some specific areas of concern in the <a 
href="labelSECTIPSSchedulingTips.html#x13-150002.2">Scheduling Tips Section </a>. This section will be
expanded significantly in the future. All of these sections are worth reading through on some slow day
for those serious about scheduling.
<!--l. 550--><p class="noindent" >VLBI projects can also be produced using the NASA Goddard program <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKED </span>and VLBA control files
can be produced using <span 
class="cmcsc-10">DRUDG</span>. That is the standard path used by the geodesy community, but is rare
among astronomers.
<!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>may be obtained by anonymous ftp from <span 
class="cmsl-10">ftp.aoc.nrao.edu </span>under directory <span 
class="cmsl-10">pub/sched</span>. For
more information, see the section on <a 
href="labelSECINSTALLInstallingSCHED.html#x34-3020004.1">Installing <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span></a>. Users are encouraged to obtained the current
release of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>before attempting to make schedules. The program is continually evolving to
support new features and to make it harder to write schedules that won&#8217;t work. It is in your own best
interests to have the current version. For most users, installing a new version should involve little
more than copying and unpacking the tar files and copying the executable for their type of
machine.
<!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" >A note on notation: the names of computer programs will be given in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SMALL CAPS </span>font, the names
of files will appear in <span 
class="cmsl-10">slant </span>font, and the names of <span
