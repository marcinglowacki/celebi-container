<!--l. 2845--><p class="noindent" >This section covers the scheduling of wide bandwidth observations. With the older tape and MARK5A
systems, that means 512 or 1024 Mbps using or using a large number of &#8221;tracks&#8221; on disk. With the
digital backends (RDBE and DBBC) and newer recording systems (MARK5C for now, maybe
MARK6 later), completely new systems are involved. The first couple of paragraphs below
are about the old systems. Then the section goes into more detail about the new digital
systems.
<!--l. 2853--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">OLD SYSTEMS:</span>
<!--l. 2855--><p class="noindent" >With the Mark5A recording system, the maximum bit rate that can normally be recorded is 1024 Mbps
on a Mark IV system and 512 Mbps on a VLBA system. These rates are recorded on a single module,
unlike in the tape era when 2 drives or 2 heads were required.
<!--l. 2860--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can make schedules for the 512 Mbps and 1Gbps modes. See the examples <a 
href="examples/eg512.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg512.key</span></a> for a
VLBA only case and <a 
href="examples/eg2head.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">eg2head.key</span></a> for a PCFS (MarkIV) case. Since the advent of disk recordings, for
the user, these modes are not much different from other modes. The VLBA telescope schedules indicate
use of the wide band mode simply through the specification of track numbers above 64.
Note that the two examples do either only VLBA or only Mark IV, but it is ok to mix
them.
<!--l. 2873--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">NEW SYSTEMS:</span>
<!--l. 2875--><p class="noindent" >New digital backends and a new recording system started to be used for science in 2012. These
increase the available bit rate to significantly higher values. The RDBE/Mark5C system
developed at Haystack and NRAO records 2048 Mbps. Higher rates may eventually be provided.
The DBBC system, developed in Italy and also using the Mark5B or Mark5C recording
systems, is being deployed on a similar time scale and has similar bandwidths. Other, even
wider bandwidth, recording systems are under development but will not be discussed here
yet.
<!--l. 2885--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4.1   </span> <a 
 id="x15-300002.4.1"></a>The RDBE system</h4>
<!--l. 2887--><p class="noindent" >The RDBE (Roach Digital Backend, where ROACH is the core board containing a large FPGA) is a
module that takes in 2 analog IF signals, applies an anti-alias filter that passes 512 to 1024 MHz, sets
the power levels, samples the signals at a 1024 MHz sample rate (8 bit samples at this stage),
digitally filters the data to the final basebands, resamples the data to 2 bits, and formats it
for recording. It takes the place of the IF distributers, baseband converters, samplers, and
formatter (including pulse cal detectors) in the old VLBA system. The VLBA antennas have
two RDBE systems each, allowing an increase in the number of channels, at least with the
DDC personality (see below). In addition to allowing increased numbers of channels, the
use of 2 RDBEs allows simultaneous access to all 4 VLBA IFs. That is useful for the S/X
system and for the new 4-8 GHz system, for which two polarization pairs of output data are
available.
<!--l. 2902--><p class="noindent" >Control of the RDBE and Mark5C recorders is handled by a new VLBA control system running on a
standard Linux computer. The new system software is based on the EVLA Executor. Schedule
information is given to this computer by way of the VEX file, which is converted by operations to a
Python script that is read by the Executor. All new hardware installed at the VLBA for the next few
                                                                                
                                                                                
years will use this control system and, probably slowly, the old hardware will be switched over to
it. In the meantime, both crd files and VEX files are needed to control the VLBA sites.
When the new 4-8 GHz receiver was installed on the VLBA, a new RF switch controller was
installed that affects all observing bands. Because of this, both the new and old control
systems must be used to support observations with either the new or old recording systems.
Note that the VEX file is also used by field system stations (EVN and others) for antenna
control.
<!--l. 2917--><p class="noindent" >The new control system at the site, and the DiFX correlator have a slightly different idea of when scans
should start compared to the old systems. With the old system, the media are commanded to start at a
time that is the same at all stations and is set as the nominal scan start time minus an offset given by
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1790003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART</span></a>. The Vex file shows that time as the uncommented &#8220;start&#8221; time of the scan. But the Vex file
also has a station dependent offset for the start of good data. With <span 
class="cmtt-10">DWELL </span>scheduling, that is usually
zero. But if <span 
class="cmtt-10">DURation </span>scheduling is used, it can be significant. That time is often referred to
as the good-data time or on-source time. It depends on <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>&#8217;s concept of slew times
and settling times. The new systems do not start the media, or the correlation until that
time.
<!--l. 2932--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">TERMINOLOGY:</span>
<!--l. 2934--><p class="noindent" >Note that the terminology for the various signals has become rather confused. For backward
compatibility in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>, we call the final analog signal sent to the sampler at 512-1024 MHz the
&#8220;IF&#8221;. That is broken into narrower bandwidths called &#8220;subbands&#8221; by a polyphase filter regardless of
RDBE personality. There is no flexibility to move those subbands around in frequency. The final signal
that is resampled to, usually, 2 bits and recorded is called the &#8220;baseband channel&#8221; for purposes of
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. The baseband channel might be a subband (PFB personality) or might be further frequency
shifted and filtered from within a subband (DDC personality). This terminology differs somewhat from
EVLA practice where a baseband is the final analog signal and the final filtered signal is a
subband.
<!--l. 2947--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">RDBE PFB PERSONALITY:</span>
<!--l. 2949--><p class="noindent" >The FPGA in the RDBE supports multiple personalities that can be swapped as needed. The first
developed was the PFB personality that uses a polyphase filter to break each of the two 512 MHz IFs
into 16 basebands of 32 MHz each, all lower sideband. Exactly 16 channels must be recorded, arbitrarily
selected from the total of 32 provided from both inputs. This personality is selected by setting the <a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2600003.6.4"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DBE</span></a>
parameter to <span 
class="cmtt-10">RDBE</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_PFB </span>in the setup file. Of the 16 subbands of the polyphase filter from each IF, 15
provide good data. The other is really 16 MHz from each end of the 512 MHz, and is not
useful. It is made available for selection in cases where it is desired to have all 16 required
channels in one polarization. More typically, 8 channels, constituting polarization pairs,
will be selected from each IF input. This personality can only provide 32 MHz basebands
at fixed frequencies within the IF for a total of 2 Gbps. Other than selecting the desired
subbands, there is no tuning flexibility. Note that the PFB personality cannot be used on both
RDBEs at a VLBA station because the required VDIF output is not available and because
the required 2 Gbps per RDBE is beyond the capacity of the recording system if both are
used.
<!--l. 2970--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">RDBE DDC PERSONALITY:</span>
<!--l. 2972--><p class="noindent" >The second personality that is available is the DDC (Digital Down Converter). It is selected using the
<a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2600003.6.4"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DBE</span></a> parameter set to <span 
class="cmtt-10">RDBE</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_DDC </span>in the setup file. This personality provides up to 4 filters per RDBE and
there are 2 RDBE units at each station. The filters can have frequencies that are multiples of 15.625
MHz (see below). The bandwidths of the DDC filters can be any factor of 2 step between 1 and 128
MHz.
<!--l. 2981--><p class="noindent" >There is a complication forced by the use of a polyphase filter first step of filtration to get the clock rate
down to values the FPGA can support. Such filters do not have flexible frequency ranges. This one
splits the band into 3 segments, 512 to 640 MHz, 640 to 896 MHz, and 896 to 1024 MHz. Each
baseband must be confined to one of those ranges. The &#8220;crossover&#8221; frequencies at the filter edges have a
                                                                                
                                                                                
range of something like 4-10 MHz (to be determined) that is not really usable. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will issue a
warning if an attempt is made to have a baseband cross one of these boundaries. Note that the
polyphase filter to use will be determined by the frequency of the LO sum. It is possible that users of
the 128 MHz bandwidth will want to offset slightly for better pulse cal performance and this will cause
a tiny fraction of the band to get aliased. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will issue warnings, but this can be
tolerated.
<!--l. 2996--><p class="noindent" >The frequencies for the band edges in the DDC personality can be set to any multiple of
256<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>(2<sup><span 
class="cmr-7">32</span></sup>) MHz = 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>0596046 Hz in principle. But values that are not integer Hz would cause
problems elsewhere - mainly with returning to phase after changes. The smallest allowed value
that qualifies is 15.625 kHz. One way to look at the allowed values is that they are N*125
kHz plus 0, 15.625, 31.250, 46.875, 62.500, 78.125, 93.750, or 109.375 kHz. If working with
other antennas with legacy systems, it will be necessary to stick to multiples of 10 kHz
which is only possible with the DDC by using multiples of 250 kHz. /schedb will warn if
the frequency is not a multiple of 250 kHz and will abort if it is not a multiple of 15.625
kHz.
<!--l. 3009--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">VLBA TUNING RESTRICTIONS:</span>
<!--l. 3011--><p class="noindent" >The overall LO/IF/RDBE system on the VLBA will have some significant tuning flexibility issues. The
RDBE is an add on to the older system where the baseband converters, which could take only a
small portion of the 500 MHz IF, provided the necessary flexibility. The LO/IF system that
creates those IFs is based on synthesizers that have set points at N*500+-100 MHz. Now,
with the ability to take all of an IF, that restricted tuning ability will become an issue,
especially in conjunction with the lack of tuning ability for the PFB personality and the
crossover points for the DDC. Essentially all frequencies can be reached using more than
one LO setting, so no cases have been identified where a particular spectral line cannot be
observed. But full tuning flexibility that might be desired is not there. Eventually we hope to
upgrade the front end synthesizers to designs with more tuning options, and in fact design
and prototyping of such a system has started, although deployment is not yet funded (Feb
2012).
<!--l. 3027--><p class="noindent" >Note that, for the initial /schedb implementation of the RDBE, the code to provide default channel
frequencies based on the band has not yet been written. It is necessary to give the frequencies in
the setup file. See the simple examples. The defaulting capability will be added eventually.
But for now, the upper-edge baseband frequencies with PFB personality must be from the
following list: 1040.0, 1008.0, 976.0, 944.0, 912.0, 880.0, 848.0, 816.0, 784.0, 752.0, 720.0,
688.0, 656.0, 624.0, 592.0, 560.0. These can either be selected directly using the <span 
class="cmtt-10">BBSYN </span>setup
file parameter, or values of <span 
class="cmtt-10">FREQREF </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">FREQOFF </span>can be selected so that the difference
between the desired baseband frequency and the signed sum of all other LOs is one of these
values.

<!--l. 3098--><p class="noindent" >See the <a 
href="labelSECREFPOINTReferencePointing.html#x17-340002.6">Reference Pointing section</a> for much more information on how to do reference pointing.
<!--l. 3102--><p class="noindent" >Reference pointing on the VLBA is handled by the legacy system using power measurements made by
the old baseband converters (BBCs). When the main observations are using the RDBE,
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>tries to set the BBCs as closely as possible to the settings of the RDBE baseband
channels. For bandwidths below 16 MHz, this can be done well for 8 channels, as long as the
requested frequency is below 1000 MHz in the IF. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will select the center 8 channels if
there are more from the RDBE (the PFB always gives 16). For wider bandwidth baseband
channels, 16 MHz will be used and it will be centered on the RDBE channel. All this means
that reference pointing, including using Doppler for setting frequencies and setting narrow
bandwidths for masers can be done normally for the DDC personality. If such reference
pointing must be done when using the PFB personality with it&#8217;s fixed 32 MHz baseband
channels, it is best to set up the old system using the piggyback scheme as demonstrated in the
example <a 
href="examples/egrdbe.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">egrdbe.key</span></a>. That requires separate runs of <span

systems.

where, like with the old BBCs, the frequency can be set flexibly anywhere in the IF band without
concern about crossover frequencies etc. The DBBC design has a module for each output baseband, so
they are more directly comparable to BBCs. Support for the DDC personality of the DBBC has been

<!--l. 3211--><p class="noindent" >There is a variant on the RDBE being developed at Haystack for mm VLBI that has 4 input IFs and
does not attempt any filtration. It simply samples and formats the data and sends it to the recorders. It
can put out 8 Gbps. This device is not yet supported by SCHED.

be told something. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>does not have a separate set of variables for all those configuration
parameters, so it just does something reasonable. It sets the number of channels to the maximum
of the number requested and 8. It sets the frequencies to cover the middle of the RDBE
basebands and the sidebands to match the RDBE basebands. It sets the sample rate to
the maximum of that requested and 32 Ms/s. It sets the channel bandwidth to the lesser
of the request and 16 MHz. It only writes the first 4 pcal extraction requests (avoiding
going into channel numbers that are too high). Recording on the Mark5A system is not
requested.
