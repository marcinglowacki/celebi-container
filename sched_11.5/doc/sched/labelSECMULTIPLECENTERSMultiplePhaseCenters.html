<!--l. 3772--><p class="noindent" >The DiFX correlator has a capability to process many phase centers within a primary beam in one pass.
It does this by cross correlating with high spectral resolution and short time integration, then splitting
the data paths out for each desired phase center, shifting the delay and phase for the new center, and
integrating in time and frequency. There is a price of about a factor of 2.5 to do the large transforms
involved, but there is very little additional burden for each phase center. The difference in processing
time between 20 phase centers and 200 is about 20%. Up to about 500 phase centers in a field have
been tested. This mode is expected to be popular for surveys and for in-beam calibration at lower
frequencies.
<!--l. 3784--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports the multiple phase center mode by providing the details of all the desired phase
centers to use for a given pointing center in the output <span 
class="cmsl-10">.v2d </span>file, which is used in correlator setup. In
the future, this information could also go to the VEX file when the standard and the readers can receive
the information.
<!--l. 3790--><p class="noindent" >To invoke multiple phase center processing, and specify the centers, the user should provide a list of all
the sources to use with each pointing center. To do this a <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1660003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PCENTERS</span></a> section should be added to the
main <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input file. Within that section, each group of centers is given a name and a list of
source names. The sources need to correspond to sources in the source catalogs. It is likely
that the user would create a catalog of the offset pointing centers and invoke it, along with
the standard catalog, using the new ability to use two source catalogs using <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1970003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">SRCFILE</span></a> and
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1980003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">SRCFILE2</span></a>.
<!--l. 3803--><p class="noindent" >To tell <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to use one of the named lists of pointing centers, specify the name of the group from
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1660003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PCENTERS</span></a> using the input <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-530003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CENTERS</span></a> for each scan. For now, the same list must be used for all scans
on a pointing center and all scans on that pointing center must use the list. The internal
structure of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will allow that one-to-one correspondence between pointing centers
and phase center lists to be relaxed if and when the information can be transmitted to the
correlator.
<!--l. 3814--><p class="noindent" >When using this capability, the user should specify the size of the FFTs to do on each baseband channel
before splitting the data for each phase center. This is done with the (new) second argument to
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-570003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CORCHAN</span></a>. Normally that argument can be ignored and the FFT size will be
set to the larger of 128 or the first argument. The FFT size needs to be large enough that there is is
insignificant delay smearing in a single channel. The required size depends on the baseband
bandwidth (B MHz) and the maximum distance between the pointing and phase centers
(x arcsec). For the VLBA for a 5% loss of amplitude on an offset source, the number of
channels should be near B*x/2.35. A somewhat more conservative criterion is to limit phase
winding to 5 spectral points per turn of phase in the spectrum. By that, given that the
maximum delay change for a 1 arcsecond shift is 139 ns on the longest VLBA baseline (8600
km), the number of channels should be near 5*0.139*B*x. The full width, half maximum
beamwidth of a VLBA antenna (25m) is very close to 30 and 1 arcminutes at 1.4 and 43 GHz,
respectively. For the 1.4 GHz case, the above two criteria give 3063 and 5004 channels for a 4
MHz baseband channel width. A specification of 4096 channels would likely be reasonable.
With the RDBE, much wider baseband channels are possible requiring many more spectral
channels.
