<!--l. 20568--><p class="noindent" >To schedule Mark&#x00A0;III projects using non-VLBA control file stations or a Mark&#x00A0;III correlator, it is best
to use <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED</span>, written by Alan Rogers and Dave Schultz at Haystack (unrelated to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>), or
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKED</span>, written by Nancy Vandenberg at Goddard Space Flight Center. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED </span>can read a very
basic <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>keyin file to get scan times and generate Mark&#x00A0;III schedules. This is mainly useful to
help get the files needed by a Mark&#x00A0;III correlator to process a Mark III observation on the
VLBA that was scheduled with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED </span>and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKED </span>produce a &#8220;Standard
Schedule File Format&#8221; file, which is also known as the &#8220;sked file&#8221;, &#8220;.vex file&#8221;, &#8220;.drg file&#8221;,
or &#8220;drudg file&#8221;. This single file contains a complete description of the experiment for all
stations.
<!--l. 20581--><p class="noindent" >There is a program called <span 
class="cmcsc-10">DRUDG</span>, associated with the Mark&#x00A0;III systems, that is used to
convert the &#8220;.drg file&#8221; into snap files to control the antennas and tape systems. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">DRUDG </span>can
produce VLBA control files and is used to do so regularily by the geodetic groups. It is
rarely used to make schedules for non-geodetic projects. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED </span>also is able to produce
VLBA control files, but this capability has not been kept up-to-date and should not be
used.
<!--l. 20589--><p class="noindent" >An NRAO program called <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKEDCONV </span>exists to convert &#8220;.drg files&#8221; files into <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>keyin files. It
is recommended that most VLBA Mark&#x00A0;III observers send their &#8220;.drg files&#8221; files to the AOC, where the
staff will use <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKEDCONV </span>and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>, along with current setup files, to make the VLBA control
files. Instructions on how to submit schedules are provided to observers when they are allocated
observing time.
<!--l. 20597--><p class="noindent" >There are no definite plans to support Mark&#x00A0;III observations fully with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>because the system
will soon be obsolete. It will be replaced by the <a 
href="labelSECRECSYSRecordingSystems.html#x14-270002.3.5">Mark&#x00A0;IV system</a>, which is basically an upgrade that
uses the same tape recorders (upgraded) and heads, but a new formatter and wider bandwidths from
the video converters. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports the Mark&#x00A0;IV system through the VEX control files. However,
as mentioned elsewhere, the Japanese systems related to VSOP have been designed around the
&#8220;.drg file&#8221;. Hooks have been provided in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>where they can attach routines to write
&#8220;.drg file&#8221; output. If this project is completed, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>may acquire at limited Mark&#x00A0;III
capability.
<!--l. 20610--><p class="noindent" >Mark&#x00A0;III observations on stations that use VLBA control files (VLBA, VLA, and Green Bank) can be
scheduled directly with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. The only difference between Mark&#x00A0;III and VLBA format projects
on these antennas is the data format on the tape (see the setup file input <a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2660003.6.4"><span 
class="cmtt-10">FORMAT</span></a>) and
various details in the setup files. Mark&#x00A0;III observations have a one-to-one correspondence
between tracks and channels, use one bit samples, and do not barrel roll. They typically
use 7 or 14 channels, although Mark&#x00A0;III format can be used on any project with no fan
out. Anyone scheduling Mark&#x00A0;III observations should either use <a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2480003.6.1">standard setup files</a> or, if
making their own, should start with a standard file as a template. Such observations can be
correlated on the VLBA correlator, but require production of a &#8220;.drg file&#8221; if sent to a Mark&#x00A0;III
correlator.
<!--l. 20626--><p class="noindent" >The PCFS can control Mark&#x00A0;III observations on Mark&#x00A0;III, Mark&#x00A0;IV, and VLBA hardware. However, it
will only do this with a Mark&#x00A0;III type &#8220;.drg file&#8221; for input. Since <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>does not produce such files,
it cannot currently schedule Mark&#x00A0;III format observations on systems that do not use the
VLBA control files (e.g.&#x00A0;the EVN). The &#8220;.drg file&#8221; is also required to control Mark&#x00A0;III
correlators, and therefore <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>cannot be used to control experiments that are destinated
                                                                                
                                                                                
for such correlators without causing considerable extra effort to generate such a file later.
A possible future upgrade to the PCFS and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>would allow the use of VEX files
to control observations on Mark&#x00A0;III hardware or configure Mark&#x00A0;III modes on Mark&#x00A0;IV
hardware.
<!--l. 20638--><p class="noindent" >The VLBA correlator is capable of correlating VLBA, Mark&#x00A0;IV, and Mark&#x00A0;III formats against each
other as long as the sample rates and recording speeds were the same. Therefore the VLBA and
Mark&#x00A0;IV stations of a global observation that also involves Mark&#x00A0;III stations could be scheduled
with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>if it were to be processed in Socorro. Of course, the Mark&#x00A0;III stations would
still have to be scheduled somehow, so one of the other programs would probably be used
anyway.
