<!--l. 4633--><p class="noindent" >There was a project to use the VLBA to provide positional data to help navigate interplanetary
spacecraft. For this project, the VLBA must be able to point at the spacecraft so the ability to do so
was added to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>as of March 2004. The spacecraft positions are obtained with the help of <span 
class="cmsl-10">spice</span>
files that are typically from JPL. In Dec. 2014, this capability was augumented to utilize TLE (Two
Line Ephemeris) files.
<!--l. 4641--><p class="noindent" >The NAIF software package from JPL is called to read the spice files and calculate positions. It is also
used in processing the TLE files. The NAIF software significantly increases the size of a
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>distribution, and the satellite tracking capability is unlikely to be needed outside the AOC.
Therefore the tracking capability is not included in the default <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>distribution.
<!--l. 4648--><p class="noindent" >To use the tracking capability, a <a 
href="labelSECSATINITSatelliteInitialization.html#x32-3000003.7"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Satellite Initialization</span></a> section needs to be included in the main
input file. That section contains a group of inputs for each satellite. There are four input parameters in
each group:
<!--l. 4654--><p class="noindent" >Note that the satellite routines also set the velocity for the satellite for use with <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-820003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DOPPLER</span></a>. The satellite
frequencies can be specified with their rest frequencies in a <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1280003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">LINEINIT</span></a> section.
<!--l. 4661--><p class="noindent" >There seems to be an incompatibility between the NAIF software used for satellite tracking and the
code used for tracking planets based on a JPL ephemeris that is used elsewhere in SCHED. It is best
not to mix the two. The satellite ephemeris files typically also contain the planets so, if you wish to
point at both satellites and planets, you can do it with the satellite files alone. Just don&#8217;t set
<span 
class="cmtt-10">ephfile</span>.
<!--l. 4668--><p class="noindent" >Note that, according to notes in the code, this satellite tracking section of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>does not take into
account diurnal aberration which it should, because it is also not taken into account in the on-line
system. The planet section of sched does take it into account. This leads to different calculated
positions when using the ephemeris and when using the satellite tracking. Some day, this should all
be handled better, but the effect is under an arcsecond so it does not matter for pointing
antennas.

the NAIF software once for a nominal position for the summary file etc, then again for every scan for
every stations to get updated positions and rates. It will also calculate an approximate parallax
correction for each station. This can amount to several arcseconds, and the calculation is believed to be
good to an arcsecond or better. The scan/station dependent positions are written to the <span 
class="cmsl-10">.crd </span>files for
the VLBA. See the note below about VEX files.

class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>plotting can help you see where the
object is going. In the RD (RA/Dec) plots, a line will be plotted for each scan. A likely use for this
capability would be to obtain the transmission schedule for a satellite over some days or weeks, make a
schedule with a scan for each period that it is transmitting, then make the RD plot and show the
calibrators. This will help identify times when the satellite is both on and near a likely phase reference
source.

users are recommended to start with that example.
<!--l. 4736--><p class="noindent" >The scheme for handling moving sources in VEX files is not yet established. However, to correlate such
observations on the VLBA DiFX correlator, a Vex file is needed for all the information other than the
positions. Thus VEX files can be written when there are moving positions, but several warnings will be
written about the use of such files. The positions of the moving sources should be obtained from
ephemeris information at correlation time, separately from the VEX file. For pointing, positions may or
may not be good enough depending on the rates. Also note that solar system objects may require
offset pointing positions between different stations and that is not described in the VEX
file.
