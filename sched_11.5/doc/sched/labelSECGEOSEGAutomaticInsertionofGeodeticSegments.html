<!--l. 3851--><p class="noindent" >Phase referencing for weak source detection and astrometry depends on the ability to transfer
interferometer phase from a calibrator to a target. The largest source of error in that transfer is the
atmosphere. The ionospheric component of the atmosphere can be calibrated using multiple observing
bands or modeled with the help of GPS based ionospheric models. The non-dispersive tropospheric
component needs to be calibrated, either by measuring gradients using multiple calibrators near the
target, or deriving the zenith delay from observations and using a mapping function to get the elevation
dependence. The latter method is generally accomplished by inserting occasional clusters of
observations of calibrators around the sky from which the clock offset and the zenith delay can be
derived. AIPS task DELZN is typically used to make the solutions, although some users have their own
programs for the purpose. These clusters of calibrator observations are called geodetic segments or
DELZN segments.
<!--l. 3867--><p class="noindent" >Constructing a geodetic segment can be tedious given that one wants low elevation observations at all
stations. The tropospheric effect scales roughly as secant(zenith angle) (hereafter SecZ). The elevations
at each VLBI station are different and change rapidly with time. It is also best to have sources that are
high at some stations and low at others to give robust SecZ fits. External programs have been written
to construct geodetic segments for insertion into SCHED and libraries of segments are available,
mostly from Mark Reid of CfA. But any schedule with such segments is tightly constrained
in time &#8212; any time shift will cause what were low elevation scans to become either high
elevation scans or scans where the source is down. Plus gathering the required segments can be
tedious.
<!--l. 3880--><p class="noindent" >/schedb can build and insert geodetic segments automatically into schedules. This should drastically
reduce the overhead in constructing such segments, and allows such segments to be made easily when
the station list is not just the VLBA. Also the schedule can be time shifted easily, a possible benefit for
dynamic scheduling. When there is a time shift, a different list of sources for each segment, optimized
for the new time, will be built. It has also been found that this capability can be used to
make short groups of scans that can be used for atmospheric opacity solutions by AIPS task
APCAL.
<!--l. 3890--><p class="noindent" >To request that a geodetic segment be built, the user should specify a scan with the parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1070003.1.2"><span

given with an argument that is the total duration of the segment (typical values are 20 to 45 minutes).
A list of sources from the normal <span

with the input parameter <a

class="cmtt-10">GEOSRCS</span></a>. Other parameters to consider to influence the source
selection are <a

class="cmtt-10">DWELL</span></a> (the length of the individual scans within the segment), <a

class="cmtt-10">OPMINANT</span></a> (the minimum

bandwidth and maybe not at the same band as the main observations). Be sure to set these
parameters back to their desired values for the main observations (<span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSEG </span>will revert to zero by
default) or you may get unexpected behavior. In addition, for the scan that is being turned
into a geodetic segment a source needs to be specified. It will be ignored in constructing
the segments, but without it some of the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>checking that comes earlier will not be
happy.
<!--l. 3915--><p class="noindent" >The parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1060003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOPRT</span></a> can be used to cause some details about each trial source sequence tested to be

<!--l. 3920--><p class="noindent" >The algorithm used to construct geo segments is described in more detail below. It involves constructing
                                                                                
                                                                                
a number of trial segments and selecting the best. There are a number of control knobs sticking out
that the user might want to play with although the defaults are reasonable. The parameter
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1120003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOTRIES</span></a> controls the number of trial segments to test. Setting <span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOTRIES </span>large will likely
produce a slightly better solution at the cost of high run times for <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. The algorithm
for picking sources is reasonably good so the best of the early tested segments is likely to
be nearly as good as anything found later. The source picking algorithm is based on fits
for secZ, with a penalty for long slews. It is also capable of leaving an antenna out of a
scan if it gets to source much later than other antennas. If that source would have been
important for the slow antenna (low elevation), it is blocked so that it can be used in a later
scan. The standard is that an antenna will be left out of the scan, or the source blocked, if
that antenna gets to source more than <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1090003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSLOW</span></a> (default 40 seconds) later than the third to
last antenna to get there. The choice of the third-to-last antenna for the reference was an
effort to deal with various awkward scenarios that can arise when not all antennas are in all
scans.
<!--l. 3944--><p class="noindent" >There is an example among the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>examples called <a 
href="examples/egdelzn.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">egdelzn.key</span></a> that shows how to construct a
file with automatic geodetic segment insertion. The <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1100003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSRCS</span></a> in that example are the set provided by
Mark Reid for his packaged geodetic segments, but with source names corresponding to those used
in the normal <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>catalog. Users are likely to just cut and paste that list into their
schedules.
<!--l. 3954--><p class="noindent" >The example <a 
href="examples/egdelzn.key" ><span 
class="cmsl-10">egdelzn.key</span></a> includes three different source lists in <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1100003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSRCS</span></a>. One is Mark Reid&#8217;s original 60
sources. In testing, this list was found to be too sparse in some parts of the sky. The second list is the
295 defining sources of the ICRF2. This should be a good list, especially at frequencies not too far from
the 2.3 and 8.4 GHz bands in which it was derived. The third list is based on the USNO
1cm survey and is should be the right one to use at 22 GHz and up. It also has over 200
sources.
<!--l. 3966--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">The algorithm:</span>
<!--l. 3968--><p class="noindent" >Note: There were minor changes to the algorithm when it got tested for 2 station observations. Those
changes are not yet reflected in the description below.
<!--l. 3972--><p class="noindent" >As long as <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is producing good geodetic segments, the details of the algorithm shouldn&#8217;t matter
too much to users. But some may wish to know, so it is described here. When starting to work on a
segment, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>calculates the elevations at the middle of the segment for all of the specified sources.
It assigns a priority for each source depending on how many stations see it at low (below
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1050003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOLOWEL</span></a>) and high (above <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1040003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOHIEL</span></a>) elevation. The best sources are low at at least two
stations and high at at least two. The next priority sources have at least one low and three
high stations or at least three low stations. The mix of low an high stations helps with
the eventual least squares fit to SecZ terms. Higher priority numbers (worse sources) are
assigned to less optimal sources. With the help of the calculated information and priorities,
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>constructs a number ( <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1120003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOTRIES</span></a> of trial geodetic segments. A quality measure for
each segment is determined by setting up a least squares fit for SecZ and clock terms. The
formal error on the fitted SecZ term for the station with the highest such error is the quality
measure.
<!--l. 3994--><p class="noindent" >An algorithm is used to construct each tested segment that tries to come up with a source set that
works reasonably well. This makes constructing each segment slow, but means that not many need to
be tested. The algorithm starts by locating the 5 closest sources in the top two priority bins to the
preceding source in the schedule. &#8220;Close&#8221; here means in terms of slew time for the array. For the first
scan of the schedule, all qualified high priority sources are considered since the array will usually slew to
the first source before the observations start. One of the chosen sources is picked at random.
Then the next source is picked at random from the 5 closest sources that either add a high
or a low observation to a number of stations that is the lesser of a third of the total or a
third of the total number of low and high scans still needed. That scheme continues until
there is at least one low and one high source for each station. That usually takes of order 6
                                                                                
                                                                                
scans.
<!--l. 4010--><p class="noindent" >For later scans in the segment, all sources given in <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1100003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSRCS</span></a> that are up at enough stations (set by
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1540003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">OPMINANT</span></a>) are tried, one at a time. A dummy least squares fit for SecZ and clock is tried with
the sources in the segment so far, up to a maximum of the preceding <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1030003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOBACK</span></a> sources.
Restricting the number in the look-back seems to help some times when choosing long segments.
The default is large (100) so there will be no effect and this should be good most of the
time, but users might want to fiddle the value. Three quality measures are considered in the
selection of the next source. The first is the improvement in the sigma for SecZ for the
station that was worst with the already-selected sources, subject to a penalty for long slew
times. If that is not sufficiently good, the source that gives the best improvement for the
previously worst antenna without the slew penalty is selected, but with a requirement that the
improvement be more significant than was required when the slew penalty was used. If even
that is not sufficiently interesting, the source that gives the best RMS improvement in the
SecZ sigmas across the array, subject to the slew penalty, is chosen. The deranged may
wish to use <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1060003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOPRT</span></a> to watch in detail , in <span 
class="cmsl-10">sched.runlog</span>, what is going on in the algorithm.
Actually you can tell quite a bit from <span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOPRT=0 </span>but you will likely need to use the code to
understand much of what is being spewed out, especially for a high value of <span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOPRT </span>such as
2.
<!--l. 4039--><p class="noindent" >Note that, in the fits, any SecZ of more than 4 (about an elevation of 15 degrees) is treated as 4. This
will make the quality of the fits seem somewhat lower but will place less emphasis on scans that are so
low that the risk of failures is great.
<!--l. 4044--><p class="noindent" >While selecting sources, normally no one source will be allowed to repeat. But sometimes there aren&#8217;t
very many low elevation options and it may be desirable to allow repeats. Parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1110003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOSREP</span></a>
sets the minimum number of scans that must go by before a source is allowed to repeat.
This was a problem for the original 60 source list, but much less so for the ICRF2 or 1cm
sources.
<!--l. 4052--><p class="noindent" >For each of the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1120003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GEOTRIES</span></a> trial segments, a quality measure is generated. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>picks the
best segment according to the quality measure, and inserts that into the schedule. The
quality measure is based on the expected errors of a fit for the zenith delay and clock for
all stations. Standard errors of 100ps are set for all observations (the value doesn&#8217;t really
matter here although a future enhancement would be to vary the number based on the source
strength) and the highest reported sigma across the stations is used as the quality measure.
This process is similar to what is done when the data are used and encourages both a high
range of elevations at each site and a significant range of elevations across antennas for each
scan.
