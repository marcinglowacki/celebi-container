<!--l. 2484--><p class="noindent" >VLBI observations require the transmission of raw data samples over very long distances. Progress is
being made toward an ultimate goal of doing this in real time over fiber networks. But EVLBI, as such
a system is called, is still only used for a small portion of VLBI observing and that is not likely to
change in some regions until more affordable access to high bandwidth networks can be
obtained.
<!--l. 2491--><p class="noindent" >Most VLBI relies on recording the raw data on magnetic media, and then shipping that media to a
correlator where it is processed days to months after the observations are made. Managing those
recordings, and the specification of the data streams to be recorded, is a major part of
scheduling with <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. This section provides background on the various recording systems in
use.
<!--l. 2498--><p class="noindent" >Please be aware that recording systems are a technology under rapid development. It is entirely possible
that some of the sections here are not entirely up to date.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x14-230002.3.1"></a>Recording Systems History and Background</h4>
<!--l. 2504--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>was originally written in about 1979 as the scheduling program for global VLBI observations
using the Mark II recording system. That was a system capable of recording 4 Mbps on video tape
recorders. It was in use in some parts of the world much longer than expected (at least to 2003),
but is now gone as far as we know. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>version 9.4 and later does not support Mark
II.
<!--l. 2511--><p class="noindent" >The wide band recording system in use for VLBI for many years was the Mark&#x00A0;III system.
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>was never a general purpose scheduling program for Mark&#x00A0;III observations. Programs <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKED</span>
and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED </span>served that role. However, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>was capable of scheduling Mark&#x00A0;III observations
on systems that used the VLBA control files (VLBA, VLA, and Green Bank). In fact, the output of
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SKED </span>and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">PC-SCHED </span>was normally processed through <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to produce the telescope control
files for these antennas for all except geodetic projects. Mark&#x00A0;III is also obsolete, although one
Mark&#x00A0;III schedule is still in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>test suite. I am not aware of any Mark&#x00A0;III systems remaining
in use.
<!--l. 2522--><p class="noindent" >The Mark&#x00A0;III system was replaced by several other systems with greater capabilities. These include the
VLBA, VLBA4, Mark&#x00A0;IV, S2, and K4 tape systems. There were correlators associated with each
system, and there was a considerable amount of cross compatibility, either directly or through the use of
translation machines. The Mark&#x00A0;III, VLBA, VLBA4, and Mark&#x00A0;IV systems all used the same tape
transport, although with different electronics. In their native modes, they used different
data formats, but the VLBA and Mark&#x00A0;IV systems were capable of reading and writing
Mark&#x00A0;III data. More importantly, the VLBA and Mark&#x00A0;IV systems have a wide range of
compatible recording modes that could be correlated together on the VLBA, JIVE, and other
correlators.
<!--l. 2534--><p class="noindent" >By 2007, the tape systems were replaced by disk based recording systems nearly everywhere. The early
disk systems were plug compatible replacements for the tape drives so most of the data configuration
remained unchanged.
<!--l. 2539--><p class="noindent" >The Mark5A system was the most widespread early disk system. It was developed by Haystack
Observatory and the Conduant Corporation. As a plug replacement for the tape drives, the Mark5A
                                                                                
                                                                                
system still has the concept of tracks.
<!--l. 2544--><p class="noindent" >The Mark5B system is an enhancement that uses the VSI standard interface to record the data
channels without all the formatting baggage left over from the tape systems. The Mark5A+ system
allows Mark5B recordings to be played on Mark5A playback units, but a minor glitch that nobody is in
a position to fix is preventing its use on the VLBA. The Mark5B+ system uses a faster interface and
can handle up to 2 Gbps.
<!--l. 2552--><p class="noindent" >The Mark5C system was being deployed in 2011 and is meant to record up to 4 Gbps, although it
the initial configuration can be used at a maximum of 2 Gbps. The Mark5C- system is a
scheme for allowing lesser Mark5 hardware to pretend to be a Mark5C system for system
development.
<!--l. 2558--><p class="noindent" >As of early 2013, the VLBA winding down use of the Mark5A system and is moving most projects over
to the Mark5C system. Some other observatories are also moving to Mark5C, but usually with different
electronics.
<!--l. 2563--><p class="noindent" >There are other recording systems in use. The Japanese have a K5 system. The Australians are using a
variant on the PCEVN system. Also a variety of groups are testing real time VLBI over the
fiber networks. This can involve real time correlation, or recording at sites remote from the
telescope.
<!--l. 2569--><p class="noindent" >Meanwhile, other potential future recording systems are being investigated.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x14-240002.3.2"></a>Recording Systems Control</h4>
<!--l. 2575--><p class="noindent" >The profusion of recording systems described in the last section is further complicated by the the
possibility of mixing elements of the different systems. There are three elements of each system that
must be specified in order to make proper schedules. These are specified in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span><a 
href="labelSECSTACATStationCatalogandLocationsCatalog.html#x28-2310003.3">station
catalog</a> with the parameters <span 
class="cmtt-10">CONTROL</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">DAR</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">DISK</span>. The first element is the
control system &#8212; what software (and hardware) is used to control the recording system.
The options that <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can handle for wide band VLBI observations are VLBA and
VEX. Formally, these actually refer to the control file type, although each type currently
implies a specific computer and software system. Note that the <span 
class="cmtt-10">CONTROL </span>variable has other
options, but they imply one of the above two, plus some specific other telescope control
files.
<!--l. 2590--><p class="noindent" >The original VLBA control system runs on VME computers using software mainly written for the
VLBA. A few other sites (VLA, Green Bank, and one of the systems at Effelsberg) have such systems
to control their VLBI hardware. Systems controlled by the VLBA software always consist of VLBA
data acquisition racks (DAR &#8212; BBCs, formatter etc) and Mark5 disks. During 2010, new Digital
Backends (RDBE) and Mark5C recorders began to be introduced on the VLBA. These major changes
are being used as an opportunity to upgrade the telescope control systems. The new system is based on
the EVLA Executor control system and runs on a standard Linux computer. Information is
passed to this system from <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>via the VEX file. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>now writes VEX files for all
observations as a result. The new control system will initially just control the new data
acquisition system and recorder. A new C-band (6cm) receiver is under construction and it, along
with all of the LO/IF switching will be placed under control of the new computer. Over
the course of the next few years, all VLBA systems will be moved to the new control. In
the meantime, both crd files for the old system and VEX files for the new system will be
required.
<!--l. 2609--><p class="noindent" >The VEX option for <span 
class="cmtt-10">CONTROL </span>causes <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to generate a schedule file in the VEX format, as does
the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-860003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DOVEX</span></a> main schedule input parameter (now the default). This is the schedule distribution file
format developed mainly for the PC Field System (PCFS) and the Mark&#x00A0;IV correlators. It is now used
by the DiFX software correlator in use at the VLBA and other places, so it is now needed by
most if not all projects. It also is needed to control all new hardware being installed on the
                                                                                
                                                                                
VLBA.
<!--l. 2619--><p class="noindent" >The PCFS, running on Linux PCs, is used to control VLBA, VLBA4, Mark&#x00A0;IV, S2, and MARK5 VLBI
hardware at many non-VLBA stations including all of the EVN. It is the descendant of, and
replacement for, the control system for Mark&#x00A0;III systems. Sometimes this system is referred
to as FS9, for &#8220;Field System 9&#8221;, referring to the earliest version that could handle VEX
input.
<!--l. 2626--><p class="noindent" >Systems controlled by the PCFS can consist of a VLBA, VLBA4 or Mark&#x00A0;IV DAR connected to a
VLBA4, VLBA, Mark&#x00A0;IV, S2, or Mark5 recorder. Each combination has slightly different capabilities
and requirements. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>understands a considerable amount about what these capabilities and
requirements are and attempts to insure that the requested observations are possible. However, when
doing a large observation with many diverse telescopes, it is best to stick to standard, well
tested, observing modes and use the frequencies selected using the setup file parameter
<a 
href="labelSECSETUPSSetupFiles.html#x31-2530003.6.4"><span 
class="cmtt-10">BAND</span></a>.
<!--l. 2637--><p class="noindent" >During the transitions between recording systems, it may not be obvious when the schedules are made
which system a station will have. Or stations may have both and want to run observations on one or
the other depending on the supply of media. Because of this situation, a separate input, called <span 
class="cmtt-10">DISK </span>can
be specified in addition to <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER </span>in the station catalog. It tells <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>that the station has a disk
system and schedules can be made for it. There is another new parameter, <span 
class="cmtt-10">MEDIADEF</span>, which can be
<span 
class="cmtt-10">TAPE </span>or <span 
class="cmtt-10">DISK</span>, that can be used to set the default medium for the station while both are available. The
<span 
class="cmtt-10">MEDIA </span>parameter in the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2090003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">TAPEINI</span></a> section can be used to override the default. ¿From this description, it
is clear that this scheme was designed for the transition from tape to disk which was finished a
few years ago. As new varieties of disk or real-time systems are implemented, changes are
likely.
<!--l. 2654--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x14-250002.3.3"></a>MARK5 and EVLBI</h4>
<!--l. 2656--><p class="noindent" >The Mark5 disk-based system has replaced the various tape based VLBI recording systems. This system
is a major advance on many fronts including scheduling. To a much greater degree than with previous
tape systems, schedulers can ignore the recording system other than making sure that they
are not scheduling to record more data than can fit on the disk space that they have been
allocated.
<!--l. 2663--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports Mark5 on the VLBA by including the required commands in the telescope control
files (the <span 
class="cmsl-10">crd </span>files). For systems controlled by the Field System (PCFS), <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>writes a <span 
class="cmtt-10">.vex </span>file in
VEX format with the necessary commands to control Mark5. The Mark5A system is meant as a plug
replacement for MarkIV or VLBA tape recorders. It still records the same tracks that would be
recorded on a tape system so <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>must still be aware of management of such issues. Such concerns
will be less, or at least different, for more advanced versions of the disk based recording
systems.
<!--l. 2673--><p class="noindent" >There are a few controls needed to schedule Mark5 natively. First, the <a 
href="labelSECSTACATStationCatalogandLocationsCatalog.html#x28-2310003.3">station catalog</a> must show that
the station has a disk system. That is done with the <span 
class="cmtt-10">DISK </span>keyword. This is separate from the <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER</span>
keyword to allow a station entry to cover both tape and disk systems during the transition period.
There is a station catalog keyword <span 
class="cmtt-10">MEDIADEF </span>that sets the default medium to use at each station.
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will use that default in the absence of an overriding <span 
class="cmtt-10">MEDIA </span>command in the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2090003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">TAPEINI</span></a> section.
Schedulers for most VLBA observations should probably ignore the problem and let operations deal
with getting the recording system right by rerunning <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>just before the observations.
For EVN and Global sessions, it should be clear before the session which system will be
used.
<!--l. 2689--><p class="noindent" >The examples <span 
class="cmsl-10">egmk5vlba.key </span>and <span 
class="cmsl-10">egmk5vex.key </span>show how to set up Mark5 observations. Now that the
conversion to disk is complete all other examples have been, or will soon be, switched to
disk.
                                                                                
                                                                                
<!--l. 2695--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports VLBI over networks. This can involve real time correlation in which case the data
are routed directly to the Network. An alternative might be called ftp VLBI. In this case, the data are
recorded at the station, then read back through the Network, or alternatively, sent over the Network
and recorded at the correlator, or both. There are a few parameters meant to help control eVLBI
observation <span 
class="cmtt-10">DATAPATH, GRABTO, GRABTIME, GRABGAP</span>. This documentation needs to be updated more
on how eVLBI is actually controlled. eVLBI is in regular use in Europe, but not on the VLBA,
mainly because of differences in the availability of affordable network connections of adequate
bandwidth.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.4   </span> <a

the VLBA hardware correlator in synchronizing playback, but is no longer of much interest as the sync

class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will not allow speedup factor changes during
mixed VLBA and Mark&#x00A0;IV mode observations. This is because of track bit rate dependent delays that
are different in the two formats. The correlator would require different clocks for different modes, which
is not yet available. Fairly soon, this restriction will be relaxed. Again, MODETEST will turn off the

<!--l. 2804--><p class="noindent" ><span

class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports observations on telescopes that have VLBA recorders but are controlled
through PCFS. This is also done by creating a <span 
class="cmtt-10">*.vex </span>file in the VEX format (see section on
<a 
href="#x14-270002.3.5"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MkIV</span></a>).
<!--l. 2809--><p class="noindent" >The telescopes are characterized by <span 
class="cmtt-10">DAR = VLBA </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER = VLBA</span>, but <span 
class="cmtt-10">CONTROL = VEX</span>. They can
have a flexible number of BBCs, and usually have only 2 IF channels: A &amp; C. The telescopes can only
be requested to record in any of the VLBA FORMATs.
<!--l. 2815--><p class="noindent" >In addition <span 
class="cmtt-10">DAR = VLBA4 </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER = VLBA4 </span>systems have been introduced. These use the
flexible <span 
class="cmtt-10">VLBA </span>data acquisition rack, but (<span 
class="cmtt-10">DAR = VLBA4</span>) have a Mark&#x00A0;IV formatter mounted
for recording up to 1Gb/s. Note that these systems write Mark&#x00A0;IV formatted data and
have been created to resemble Mark&#x00A0;IV systems. In this sense their name is misleading.
These systems required a <span 
class="cmtt-10">RECORDER = VLBA4 </span>in the tape era in order to accommodate 2
recording heads (optional), but now all Mark5A systems can record the requisite number of
tracks.
<!--l. 2825--><p class="noindent" >Most of the VLBA racks controlled by the field system have what is known as the &#8220;geodetic
wiring&#8221;. This means that not all of the BBCs can see all IFs. Also, there are not enough
sampler inputs do use 2 bit samples from more than the first 8 BBCs. In fact, switching
between lots of BBCs at one bit and 8 BBCs at 2 bits requires moving connectors that really
weren&#8217;t designed to be moved often. This is an invitation for trouble. The IF restrictions
are such that BBCs 1-8 can see IFs A and C while BBCs 1, 2, and 9-14 can see B and D.
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>understands these restrictions in it&#8217;s automatic BBC assignment section. Note that, in
some cases, the stations will put the same signals on IFs A and B and on C and D. This
can be dealt with in the frequency catalog by giving B as the ALTIFN for A and D as the
ALTIFN for C (or visa versa). Or, or course, you can specify IFCHAN explicitly in the setup
file.
