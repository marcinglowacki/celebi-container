<!--l. 10797--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>uses a catalog to get station information such as names, positions, horizons, slew
characteristics and more. This catalog is in keyin format. Station positions may be stored separately in
a Locations Catalog. There are standard Station and Location Catalogs which will almost certainly
have all stations used by a project. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will find these catalogs by default or their locations may
be specified. Any or all of the Station Catalog entries may be given in the main <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED </span>input if
desired. In any case, the scheduler should consult the catalog to be sure that the right station names
are being used in the schedule. The catalog associated with this release of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is at
<a 
href="catalogs/stations.dat" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">$SCHED/catalogs/stations.dat</span></a>.
<!--l. 10810--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input parameter <span 
class="cmtt-10">STAFILE </span>is used to point to any desired external catalog. A file
name of up to 80 characters can be specified. The default is the standard catalog for digital
backends:
<!--l. 10813--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">STAFILE=$SCHED/catalogs/stations</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_RDBE.dat</span>. Eventually that will be set back to
<span 
class="cmtt-10">STAFILE=$SCHED/catalogs/stations.dat </span>once the conversion of documentation and examples is
complete.
<!--l. 10817--><p class="noindent" >Station catalog information can be given in the main <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>keyin file. If the keyword <span 
class="cmtt-10">STACAT</span>
appears, all input after the next &#8220;/&#8221; is assumed to consist of station catalog entries until a line
containing the keyword <span 
class="cmtt-10">ENDCAT </span>and a &#8220;/&#8221; is encountered (don&#8217;t combine this keyword with a catalog
entry). Such &#8220;in-line&#8221; catalogs must appear in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>keyin file before the all of the input for
the first scan is complete. This allows the use of station codes to specify stations in each
scan.
<!--l. 10826--><p class="noindent" >Both in-line catalog entries and an external catalog may be used for the station catalog. This
would mainly be useful if there is a non-standard antenna in the schedule. That antenna&#8217;s
parameters can be put in the in-line catalog while all other antennas are picked up from the
external catalog. If you wish to prevent <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>from looking in external catalogs, specify
<span 
class="cmtt-10">STAFILE=NONE</span>.
<!--l. 10833--><p class="noindent" >It is only necessary to give one of <span 
class="cmtt-10">X</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">Y</span>, and <span 
class="cmtt-10">Z </span>or <span 
class="cmtt-10">ELev</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">LAT</span>, and <span 
class="cmtt-10">LONG</span>. The missing set will be calculated.
If both are given, the provided values will be used. If a conversion is done, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used
and the calculations are accurate at the cm level. Since WGS84 is tied to the ITRF, this
should be a good way to convert GPS coordinates to the Earth centered coordinates used in
VLBI.
<!--l. 10841--><p class="noindent" >Some of the information that can be given in the station catalog can also be provided through a
locations catalog. This is mostly position information. The locations catalog can be specified by
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1310003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">LOCFILE</span></a>. See the description of that parameter for a list of the station parameter that can be in the
locations catalog. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will read and store the locations catalog before reading the
stations catalog. If the station position is missing from the stations catalog, <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will
search for a station in the locations catalog with the name specified with <span 
class="cmtt-10">DBNAME </span>in the
stations catalog. If a match is found, the associated coordinates will be used. The locations
catalog is used because, in the standard catalogs, the station locations are from the VLBA
correlator data base while all the other information is from other places. It is much easier to
maintain separate catalogs. Users will probably not need to worry about all this, except
perhaps to specify <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1310003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">LOCFILE</span></a> if they keep the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>standard catalogs in a non-standard
place.
<!--l. 10861--><p class="noindent" >The parameters of the station catalog are given below. Items that can be in the locations catalog are

     the
     first

     a
     particular
     setup
     is
     seen.
     Like

     the

     this
     parameter
     acts
     exactly
     like
     <span

     but
     only
     for
     the
     first
     scan
     with
     a
     particular
     setup.
     The
     VLBA
     needs
     15
     seconds.
     The
     VLA
     needs
     60
     seconds.
     As
     of
     Nov.
     2012,
     the
     VLA
     actually
     needs
     this
     every
     time
     there
     is
     a
     slight
     frequency
     change
     (like
     new

     shift),
     but
     we
     will
     try
                                                                                
                                                                                
     to
     get
     that
     changed
     to
     be
     only
     for
     more
     major
     changes.
     Note
     that,
     if
     the
     first
     scan
     with
     a
     setup
     is
     non-recording,
     non-pointing,
     and
     non-phasing,
     the
     scan
     itself
     will
     be
     accepted
     as
     the
     level
     setting
     (DUMMY
     on
     the
     VLA)
     scan.
     This
     allows
     for
     explicit
     insertion
     of
     DUMMY
     scans.
