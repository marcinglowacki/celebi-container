     The
     end
     of

     era

     I
     thought.
     Put
     it
     back
     14
     Feb
     2003.
     I
     have
     been
     informed
     by
     Igor
     Molotov
     that
     Mark
     II
     is
     still
     used
     occasionally
     in
     Russia
     (4
     sites),
     Ukraine,
     Latvia,
     Poland,
     India,
     and
     China
     and
     still
     exists
     at
     Noto
     and
     Medicina!
     It
     is
     used
     for
     radar
                                                                                
                                                                                
     observations
     that
     don&#8217;t
     need
     much
     bandwidth.
     When
     I
     tested
     the
     reinstallation,
     I
     found
     and
     fixed
     a
     problem
     with
     old
     and
     new
     versions
     that
     caused
     a
     core
     dump.
     Just
     before
     the
     18
     Sept
     release
     I
     found
     another

This release makes available some important fixes required for 3mm VLBA projects. But
it does not have some fixes for VEX problems that will affect CMVA runs. So there will
be another release in a couple of weeks. The changes here are not significant for users not
attempting reference pointing with <span 
class="cmtt-10">AUTOPEAK </span>or other mechanism that invokes setup files with
<span 
class="cmtt-10">FORMAT=NONE</span>. If you don&#8217;t need this one right now, it is recommended you wait for the VEX
fixes.

     &#8220;The

     quite
     a
     bit)
     is

     can
     now
     deal
     with
     more
     complex
     schedules.
     There
                                                                                
                                                                                
     used
     to
     be
     a

     in

     that
     could
     not

     with.
     That
     is
