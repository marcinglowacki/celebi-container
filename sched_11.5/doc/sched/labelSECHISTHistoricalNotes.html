class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>was written by R.C.&#x00A0;Walker (RCW) in the late 1970&#8217;s for Mark&#x00A0;II VLBI scheduling. It was
part of the Caltech VLBI package. It received a number of modifications over the following decade by
the author and others, including Tim Pearson, John Benson, and Mark Hodges. Beginning in 1988, the
program was extensively revised by RCW to accommodate VLBA, and eventually global VLBI,
scheduling. In 1991, a project to write <span 
class="cmcsc-10">VLBA OBSERVE </span>was been begun by the NRAO with
the programming being done by Wes Young. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>development was at a a minimal
level during this development project as it was thought that the program would soon be
retired.
<!--l. 19483--><p class="noindent" >In the Fall of 1995, the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">VLBA OBSERVE </span>project was cancelled. An intensive effort was made then to
add many of the features whose need had become apparent during the period of minimal development.
In the Spring of 1996, Huib van&#x00A0;Langevelde of JIVE, then stationed at NRAO, began work on the VEX
additions which became a significant part of the program. Also, at about that time, Brian Butler
provided the code needed to add the planet capability that is important for single dish pointing and
gain measurements at high frequencies. Rick Lively provided systems support including writing
makefiles and helping with interactions with users who were trying to install the programs on other
machines. In January 1998, Franco Tinarelli of Bologna delivered the first code for point-and-click
control of the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>plotting functions and has been supporting the plot functions ever
since. In 2002, Cormac Reynolds took over support of the Vex portions of the code from
Huib.
<!--l. 19499--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>is currently the primary scheduling program used for astronomical VLBI. It is also capable of
scheduling many types of observations on the VLA.
