<!--l. 1807--><p class="noindent" >A tremendous amount could be said about observing strategy. See the article by Joan Wrobel in the
book &#8220;Very Long Baseline Interferometry and the VLBA&#8221; (1995: ASP) for a good discussion. That
book also contains a lot of information about VLBI and is a good reference for all observers to have.
Other important sources of information are the &#8220;VLBA Observational Status Summary&#8221;
and &#8220;General Instructions on Observation Preparation&#8221; (which is sent to scheduled users).
These and many other useful documents can be accessed on the Internet from the <a 
href="http://www.vlba.nrao.edu/astro" >&#8220;VLBA
Information for Astronomers&#8221;</a> page. This section of the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>Manual will be limited to a
few important concepts to keep in mind while scheduling. It is assumed that the observer
already has a reasonable idea of how much time is needed per source, what frequencies to
observe, etc. The suggestions here are more oriented toward smooth observing, processing, and
calibration.

     This

     delays
     on

     This
     is
     simply
     done
     by
     running
     the
     fringe

     it
     helps
     to
     have
     a

     Ideally,

     source
     of
     known

     on
     the
     VLA,
     to
     calibrate
     the
     flux
     densities.
     However,
     by
     their
     nature,
     sources
     that

     compact
     to
     VLBI
     (essentially
     none
     are

     are
     variable
     and,
     therefore,
     do

     In

     this,
     be
     sure
     to
     include
     a
     VLA
     flux
     calibrator
     (usually

     don&#8217;t
     need
     to
     record

     it.
     This
     method
     can
     go
     awry
     if
     the
     calibrator
     has
     intermediate

     <!--l. 1867--><p class="noindent" >It
     is
     also
     possible,
     and
     perhaps
     preferable,
     to
     rely
     on
     the
     apriori
     calibration
     of
     the
     VLBI
     antennas.
     For
     this,
     it
     is
     best
     to
     look
     carefully
     at
     your
     data
     and
     determine
     which
     subset

     consistent
     calibration.
     With
     the
     VLBA
     at
     intermediate
     frequencies,
     it
     is
     possible
     to

     right
     to
     within
     a
     few
     percent
     this
     way.
     You
     just
     have
     to
     be
     sure
     not
     to
     let
     any
     antennas
     with

     weather
     or
     other
     problems
     contribute
     to
     the

     In
     the
     AIPS
     calibration
     task
     CALIB,
     use
     ANTUSE

     Also

     elevation,
     such
     as
     30
     degrees,
     for

     must
     be
     taken
     with

     calibration
     and
     channel
     selection.
     The

     based
     on
     total
     power
     measurements
     from
     the

     Such
     gains
     apply
     to
     the
     average
     across
     the
     full
     baseband.
     If
     you
     attempt

     apply
     such
     gains
     to
     a
     data
     set
     with

     removed,
     there
     will
     be
     an
     error
     of
     a
     few
     percent
     because
     those
     edge

     typically
     have

     the
     average
     for
     the
     remaining
     channels
     will
     be
     higher.
     You
     can
     deal
     with
     this
     either
     by
     doing
     the
     calibration
     including
     all

     or
     by
     doing
     a

     calibration
     based
     on
     all
     channels.
     Bandpass
     calibration
     brings
     all

     At

     the
     Tsys
     used

     the

     the

     being

     Except
     for
     phase
     or

     reference
     calibrators,
     there
     will
     typically
     be
     only
     2
     or
     a
     few
     more
     scans
     on
     each
     calibrator
     of
     the
     types
     discussed
     above.
     It
     is
     tempting
     to
     put
     these
     scans
     at
     the
     beginning
     and
     end
                                                                                
                                                                                
     of
     the
     scheduled
     observing
     time.
     However
     this
     is
     quite
     risky
     as
     those
     are
     the
     time
     periods
     most
     likely
     to
     experience
     problems.
     The
     beginning
     is
     especially
     risky
     because,
     if
     there
     are
     any
     problems
     at
     a
     site,
     they
     may
     not
     have
     been
     fixed
     yet.
     The
     end
     is
     ok,
     except
     at
     sites
     where
     the

     has
     been
     down
     for
     a
     while
     and
     the

     has
     been
     idle.
     It

     not
     wake
     up
     again
     cleanly
     for
     the
     calibration
     scans.
     It
     is
     best
     to
     take
     time
     (a
     few
     minutes
     on
     each
     calibrator)
     out

next sources along with the slew rates and accelerations for the antenna. An additional
time <span

ready. Additional time might be added for digital systems to set power levels based on
<span 
class="cmtt-10">TLEVSET </span>for the first time a setup is seen (VLBA and VLA). The total time to be ready
will not be less than <span 
class="cmtt-10">MINSETUP</span>, even if the slew is fast and the settling time (<span 
class="cmtt-10">TSETTLE</span>) is
short.
<!--l. 2139--><p class="noindent" >The slew time calculator tries to take into account the need for cable wraps. The algorithm is simply &#8212;
the shortest path to the next source will be taken even if that turns out not to be optimal later. Early
VLBA experience suggested that a simple, predictable algorithm was preferred over a more optimal,
but hard to predict, algorithm.
<!--l. 2145--><p class="noindent" >After the nominal times are determined, the recording start time is adjusted as described in the
<a 
href="#x13-190002.2.2">Adjusting the Scan or Recording Start Time section</a> below using <a

href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span

adjustments were used to allow time for the recording media to get up to speed, formatters to
reconfigure between scans with different setups, and for playback to synchronize on correlation. These
were significant issues with the old tape systems, and to a lesser extent with the MARK5A system. The
newer MARK5C recording system and DiFX correlators, and perhaps others, are able to record
and correlate data beginning right at the assigned start time so such adjustments are not
required.
<!--l. 2160--><p class="noindent" >The date specification for a scan is for the scan stop time, regardless of how the scan times are
specified. If there is a scan that crosses midnight, this can cause some confusion, especially if it is the
first scan of the experiment and the date is being specified along with <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2010003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">START</span></a>. If a schedule crosses a day
boundary and <span 
class="cmtt-10">START </span>or <span 
class="cmtt-10">STOP </span>times are being specified, the new day should be specified. However, if
midnight is crossed during any form of duration scheduling, the day will be incremented
automatically.
<!--l. 2171--><p class="noindent" >All scans for a given station must be specified in time order. However, it is not necessary
for scans for different stations to be in time order. This allows, for example, for the scans
for one antenna to be specified separately from the scans for another antenna. While this
works, it is not recommended because <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>does not try to identify scans that can be
correlated together. Anything that depends on knowing what the whole array is doing is
likely to fail. <span 
class="cmtt-10">DWELL </span>time scheduling is one such item because <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>must know how
long the slews are for all antennas in a scan. Plotting of u-v coverage is another because
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>only plots u-v points for baselines between antennas in the same scan. The estimates
of data volumes and rates from the correlator, given in the summary file, are yet another
because they depend on counts of baselines. Finally, any VEX file produced in such a way is
likely to cause problems at a correlator that depends on it, such as DiFX (VLBA and many
others).

href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1320003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">LST</span></a> parameter. For VLBI, the concept of LST
needs a bit more specification since it is different for each element of the array. <span 
class="cmtt-10">LST </span>can take an
argument which is the station whose LST is to be used. If there is no argument, that station is assumed
to be the VLA since LST scheduling was most commonly used for VLA schedules when the capability
was first added to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span>. Now that dynamic scheduling is being used on the VLBA, many
users will want to set <span 
class="cmtt-10">LST=VLBA</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_PT </span>to conform to the style of scheduling requested for such
projects.
<!--l. 2199--><p class="noindent" >If <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1320003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">LST</span></a> is specified, there are two ways to set the date. With the original method, the year and month
are ignored and the day is assumed to be the (modified?) julian sidereal day number. Finding the LST
day can be a bit painful, but a rough estimate can be had from the fact that LST day 60501 was 2006
Feb. 16. The estimate can be put in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to narrow down to the right date. The second
method is much easier and the scheme normally used. It is to specify the UT day in the usual
manner. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>will attempt to figure out the LST day number, taking into account the
fact that 0 hours LST is sometime in the middle of the UT day. It will also check if your
start time is in the approximately 3.9 minutes where the result is ambiguous (LST days are
                                                                                
                                                                                
shorter than UT days) and request specification of the LST day number &#8212; giving you the
options.

<!--l. 2218--><p class="noindent" >It is a very good idea, when using LST scheduling, to check the final output schedules, which are all in

<!--l. 2222--><p class="noindent" >When dynamic scheduling, it is often difficult to mesh projects together perfectly. This can lead to gaps
in scientific observing which causes an under-utilization of the array. <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>supports two features
that are meant to help with this situation. The first is that the user can specify optional scans on the
ends of the project by setting <a

class="cmtt-10">PREEMPT</span></a> <span 
class="cmtt-10">= EXTRA </span>for those scans. The scans will appear in the
summary file so their properties are clear, but will not be passed to the machine readable files
used to control the antennas. To activate them, so they are on the control files, parameter
<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-830003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DOSCANS</span></a> can be used to select the scan range to be used. The second option applies to 24
hour schedules which could be started at times other than in the original schedule and
wrapped around the day. Parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2280003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">WRAP24</span></a> causes <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to copy the scans onto the end of
the original scans to make a 48 hour schedule. <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-830003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DOSCANS</span></a> is then used to select the desired
24 hour block. It is expected that <span 
class="cmtt-10">DOSCANS </span>and <span

personnel.

<!--l. 2249--><p class="noindent" >NOTE: Concerns about formatter reconfigurations will disappear when the digital backends take over.
About half of VLBA projects use the new system as of the start of 2013 and that should go to all
during the year, so soon this section will be obsolete.
<!--l. 2254--><p class="noindent" >A factor to consider when planning scan times is legacy formatter reconfigurations. These happen when
the internal switching and setup of the formatter at the station has to be changed. Such changes
happen when any of a number of parameters, including the number of channels, the sample rate, the
BBC assignments, the BBC sidebands, and the pulse cal detector setup, are modified. A formatter
reconfiguration takes about 8 seconds on the VLBA and during that time the formatter is not sending
valid time codes to the recorder. If this happens during recording, it knocks the correlator out of sync
for both the duration of the reconfigure plus the time to resync. In practice, it also seemed to
confuse the old VLBA hardware correlator somehow for maybe one or two stations and
they can take over a minute to resync. This is not likely to be the case for the software
correlator.
<!--l. 2269--><p class="noindent" >It is best to avoid reconfigurations if possible. In the rare cases where that is not possible, try to provide
a gap between scans of sufficient length to do the reconfiguration. The formatter configuration
requested during a gap is the same as that during the following scan, so this only requires using the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1020003.1.2"><span

command (or any other mechanism for having one scan start a while after another ends). Common
reasons that reconfigurations occur in schedules are changes in the sample rate, changes in the BBC
sideband (remember for net upper sideband, the 20cm and 13cm systems on the VLBA use lower
sideband at the BBC), and changes in the kHz part of the frequency which changes the pcal detector
frequency (changes in the MHz part will not change the pcal setup and will not trigger a
reconfigure).

<!--l. 2287--><p class="noindent" >The nominal scan start time, if set using <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-880003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">DWELL</span></a>, is the time good data is expected to be available. If
recording and correlation could start instantly, that would also be a good time to start the recorders.
The more modern systems, especially the Mark5C recorders and the software correlators, approach this
                                                                                
                                                                                
ideal and the recordings are started at the time specified in the VEX file for the start of good data.
That time is calculated based on the expected slew rates and on any extra time, specified using the
<span 
class="cmtt-10">TSETTLE, MINSETUP </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">TLEVSET </span>parameters in the <a 
href="labelSECSTACATStationCatalogandLocationsCatalog.html#x28-2310003.3">station catalog</a>. The start can also be
postponed with <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1020003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">GAP</span></a> or <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1780003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESCAN</span></a>. With fixed scheduling (<a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-870003.1.2"><span

href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2010003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">START</span></a>, etc), the nominal scan
starts are forced by <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>, but the time of good data, if later than the scheduled scan
start, is still set by the actual expected slews and additions and that is believed by the
Mark5C control software and the correlator. Parameters <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span></a> and <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1790003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART</span></a>, discussed
below have no actual effect if the derived start time is before the expected start of good
data.
<!--l. 2312--><p class="noindent" >With older systems, including the MARK5A systems that are still in use at least part time at the
beginning of 2013, it can take a small amount of time to get the the recording going at the stations and
the correlation fully synced up. With previous generation correlators and tape recorders, this was a
serious issue and it was advisable to start the recordings at least 20 seconds before good data.
Modern (2010) correlators are faster so the total time needed for both starting recording and
synchronizing is only a few seconds, or less. Another reason for possibly starting recordings
early, or even recording continuously between scans is that the Mark5A disk system can
only handle up to 1024 recording scans. A recording scan is the time between stops of the
recording media. There might be several source scans in a recording scan. Fast-switching,
phase-referencing observations with the older systems could run into this issue so the default <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span></a>
(see below) has been set to prevent recording gaps during the fast-switching in appropriate
cases. This section describes the tools in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to allow the recordings to be started
early.
<!--l. 2332--><p class="noindent" >The schemes described in the <a 
href="#x13-170002.2.2">scan times section</a> (parent of this section) are used to set the times of the
scans as reported in the output files meant for human consumption. But the telescope control files
actually give the times for the recording to start and stop. For the legacy (Mark5A) systems, those
times are in the <span 
class="cmsl-10">crd.xx </span>files for VLBA systems and as the uncommented scan-wide start time in the
$SCHED section of the VEX file. For the RDBE (VLBA etc) and WIDAR (VLA) systems, it is
the data good time in the VEX file, shown for each telescope as an offset from the start
time.
<!--l. 2344--><p class="noindent" >There are two primary parameters that can affect the recording start time used for the legacy systems.
They are <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1790003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART</span></a>, and <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span></a>. <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1790003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART</span></a> is used to request that the recording be started the
requested amount of time (record time) before the scan start time. If that time is earlier than the
previous stop time, the recorder will be left running.
<!--l. 2354--><p class="noindent" >The extreme, and often useful, case of a pre-start is to not stop recording between scans. This is
especially useful if you have many short scans with short intervals between them, such as when phase
referencing. <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span></a> sets the smallest gap between scans for which the recording will be stopped. If
the gap is smaller, the recorder will be left running. <span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE </span>used to be in units of playback time, so it
was multiplied by the speed up factor to get the effect at record time. The speedup factor is no longer a
simple concept so that adjustment has been removed and now <span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE </span>applies to the record
time.
<!--l. 2366--><p class="noindent" >The default value for <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1790003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART</span></a> is 5 seconds when the <span 
class="cmtt-10">DAR </span>is the legacy VLBA system or the MKIV
system. Otherwise it is zero, which will be the case with the modern digital systems. The default value
for <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1340003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span></a> is 10 seconds when using the Field System or the legacy VLBA DAR. Otherwise it is zero
which is the case for the new VLBA digital system. The Field System with the DBBC may be switched
to zero in the future.
<!--l. 2376--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART </span>is applied before <span 
class="cmtt-10">MINPAUSE</span>. First the recording start time is shifted earlier, then the interval
from the last stop time is examined to determine if the recording should be left running. The defaults
of <span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART=5, MINPAUSE=10 </span>should be ok in most situations (they are also in a state
of flux as of the end of 2010, so it is possible they have changed since this was written).
Users should not need to worry about these parameters most of the time. The offset of the
recording start time from the scan start time can be displayed in the summary file by adding
                                                                                
                                                                                
<span 
class="cmtt-10">PTSTART </span>to the arguments of <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-2040003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">SUMITEM</span></a>. The recording start time is also available in the <span 
class="cmsl-10">sch.</span>
files.
<!--l. 2390--><p class="noindent" >Another way to shift the recording start time is to use the parameter <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1780003.1.2"><span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESCAN</span></a>. This parameter was the
original way of introducing gaps between scans, but was considered obsolete in recent years. However, it
may have a use as a way of increasing the time allowed between scans beyond what would be given with
the station parameter <span 
class="cmtt-10">TSETTLE</span>, although a negative <span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESTART </span>can do the same thing. <span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESCAN </span>shifts
the start time in either direction (positive shifts to later times) after the other parameters
discussed above set the time. If a positive <span 
class="cmtt-10">PRESCAN </span>is given, and the <span 
class="cmtt-10">DURation </span>or <span 
class="cmtt-10">DWELL </span>is
increased by the same amount, the whole scan can be shifted farther from the period of
the slew, allowing somewhat increased confidence that the recording will start with good
data.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x13-200002.2.3"></a>Dynamic Scheduling</h4>
<!--l. 2406--><p class="noindent" >All of projects on the VLBA that do not involve other antennas or special constraints are scheduled
dynamically. That means that they are put into a special queue, along with information about their
minimum requirements, and then are run at an appropriate time given the weather and condition of the
equipment. This increases the overall quality of VLBA output by avoiding observations at times when it
is clear that the results will be poor, even if it also introduces inefficiencies in scheduling that mean that
there is some idle time (projects don&#8217;t mesh together perfectly). For example, there is not
much point in observing at 43 GHz when there is bad weather at many sites. But a 1.6
GHz observation at the same time might be fine. Dynamic scheduling also allows more
flexible response to targets of opportunity. Galactic sources, in particular, tend to have
short periods of enhanced activity so it is best to be able to observe when they are high.
Of course, it is possible that some projects in the dynamic scheduling queue will never be
scheduled.
<!--l. 2423--><p class="noindent" >The PI for a dynamically scheduled project will be given a window in LST at the VLBA_PT (Pie
Town) that will be scheduled, if the observation is done. It is useful slotting projects together if the PI
allows some flexibility in the actual start time. The PI should prepare a schedule using the <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-1320003.1.2">LST</a>
parameter with Pie Town as an argument (<span 
class="cmtt-10">LST=VLBA</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_PT</span>).
<!--l. 2431--><p class="noindent" >When a program is selected for a dynamically scheduled time slot, VLBA operations personnel will
modify the date (calendar or lst day number) to match the scheduled day. This last minute modification
is necessary because the stations do not have an LST concept and the machine readable files delivered
by <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>must be in UT. The files will then be loaded to the sites with instructions about the time
window to use, which may well be a subset of what is actually in the schedules. Because of this last
minute modification of the date, it is best to minimize the use of dates in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>input. Use
durations instead.
<!--l. 2442--><p class="noindent" >To provide flexibility in the start time, it is useful to schedule using <a 
href="labelSECSCHPARTheScheduleFile.html#x26-880003.1.2">DWELL</a> to set the
scan lengths. Then <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>can adjust the gaps between scans to allow for the slew times
that will be experienced by the actual observations. If doing an astrometric project with
&#8220;DELZN&#8221; segments (geodetic type observing all over the sky to solve for the zenith atmospheric
delay), it is useful to use the ability of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">SCHED</span><span 
class="cmcsc-10">&#x00A0;</span>to <a 
href="labelSECGEOSEGAutomaticInsertionofGeodeticSegments.html#x19-360002.8">construct such segments automatically</a>.
Since such segments depend on observing sources near rise and set, they cannot be moved
around, so without the automatic construction of the segments, the start time cannot be
changed.

<!--l. 2459--><p class="noindent" >For most VLBI observations, the data are recorded at the stations and played back later at the
correlator. It is not yet possible for the recording process to be totally transparent to the user, but
dealing with it is now much less of a burden than it was in the tape era. A top level issue is that a user
is typically allocated a total amount of recording media that he/she is allowed to use. This number may
be less than the total that could be recorded during the observation. It is required because the overall
media supply may not be large enough to allow full time recording at the maximum bit rate and the
scheduling committees need to apportion the resources according to the project needs and
priorities.
<!--l. 2471--><p class="noindent" >Beyond the overall amount of data recorded, the disk-based systems still require the user to pay
attention to the need for data quality checks, to maximum reasonable recording scan lengths, to the
need for time at non-VLBA stations for module swaps, and to dealing with the fact that the
correlatable data is not provided starting at the exact time specified for starting the recording. These
topics are discussed in the <a
