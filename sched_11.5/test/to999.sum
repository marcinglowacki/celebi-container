DERIVED INFORMATION FOR CORRELATION: 
                                                All scans
  Elapsed time for project (hours):                 0.66
  Total time in scheduled scans (hours):            0.33
  Total time in recording scans (hours):            0.33
  Total baseline hours (recording scans):           1.00
  Projected max correlator output rate (kB/s):       6.1
  Projected correlator output data size (MB):        7.4
 NOTES:  Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.
         The 'baseline hours' include the autocorrelations (for data size calculations).
         The correlator output data rate is for real-time processing.
         Above numbers assume the same correlator parameters are used for all data.
         The recordings for a scan are assumed to start at the scan START minus PRESTART.
         Some stations (VLA, VLBA/MARK5C) wait for good data so the estimates may be high.

  Notes on the station scan summaries: 

    "Record Scans" are periods of recording with no gap.  The Mark5A disk systems 
    have a limit of 1024 such scans.  There are often multiple projects on a disk pack.
    If using MARK5A, try to keep above about 6 GB per record scan by using MINPAUSE 
    and PRESTART to prevent short gaps.  However, also try to prevent record scans 
    of more than an hour to minimize risk to data from playback problems.
    MARK5C will have one observe scan per record scan and there is no limit to the number.

EFFECT OF SOLAR CORONA

  The solar corona can cause unstable phases for sources too close to the Sun.
  SCHED provides warnings at individual scans for distances less than 10 degrees.
  The distance from the Sun to each source in this schedule is:
    Source         Sun distance (deg) 
   0528+134            15.4
   GALAXY15            42.2

  Barry Clark estimates from predictions by Ketan Desai of IPM scattering sizes 
  that the Sun will cause amplitude reductions on the  longest VLBA baselines 
  at a solar distance of 60deg F^(-0.6) where F is in GHz. 
  For common VLBI bands, this is: 
       327 MHz        117. deg 
       610 MHz         81. deg 
       1.6 GHz         45. deg 
       2.3 GHz         36. deg 
       5.0 GHz         23. deg 
       8.4 GHz         17. deg 
      15.0 GHz         12. deg 
      22.0 GHz          9. deg
